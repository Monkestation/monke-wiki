Do not play this without some experience as a Cargo Technician first, you'll ruin the round.

As a Quartermaster, your primary job is to ~~flood the station with paperwork and more paperwork~~ order equipment to help keep the station running. Make sure credits aren't wasted, kick the clown out, and make sure your Cargo Techs aren't getting into trouble - and pull their arses out of the fire when they do. You have three helpers to ~~run off with anything not bolted to the ground and ignore you~~ help you redistribute things throughout the station. You also have authority over mining, and should try and coordinate the Shaft Miners to meet the needs of the station -- primarily, this means passing on requests from Robotics, Research, and Engineering.

You have sunglasses, a unique jumpsuit, mining access, and your own office. ~~This is all that distinguishes you from a Cargo Technician.~~ The Head of Personnel can waltz in at any time and order or take whatever they want. As the Quartermaster is now considered a Head, you are no longer shackled to the HoP! Still expect to be bullied by them.

Bare minimum requirements: Try to get some bounties completed and make sure your hard-earned credits aren't wasted. 

# Supply Shuttle Console

"Who the hell blew all our credits on Wizard Costumes?"

The Cargo Bay and your office is filled with paper, paper and more paper. Most importantly, there is a console to order items. Everything that people will expect you to order that cannot be procured from the autolathe will show up on the Supply Shuttle once it arrives at CentCom.

Each order will produce a requisition form, which is usually best just shoved in the adjacent filing cabinet and forgotten until Security kicks down your door demanding to know who flooded the station with shotguns and clown outfits. Try and make sure that you know who ordered what. Your console and the one in the Cargo Office are ID-locked, requiring Cargo Bay access to function, meaning that only your subordinates (Cargo Technicians) and Superiors (Captain) can order stuff unless they somehow got access. 

# Cargo Budget

You have a cargo budget card in your bag. You can insert cash directly into the card and the money will go to the cargo budget, but you cannot take cash out of it or use it to buy privately. Every order on your console requires you to spend credits. The pool of credits is also used for other station purchases, such as custom shuttles, and to fund large station projects. As the QM, it is your job to make sure the station has enough credits to do so. To withdraw physical cash you must use the a machine in the vault.

Check out the Supply Crates page for details about how to make money.

## Direct Deposit, Direct Theft

The Vault contains a machine that accepts physical space cash and coins and adds it to the cargo budget's total credits. This machine can also be robbed by unsavory individuals, causing you to lose credits, but there will be a loud warning ("Unauthorized credit withdrawal") if this happens. The Quartermaster can enter the vault by using the supply door remote, found in the QM's locker.

# Crates

"Robotics is bugging me for a Ripley Crate - Everyone point and laugh."

Crates are the lifeblood of your department. Ideally, you'll be ordering quite a few of them. These can be delivered via MULEbot, via the mail office, via people picking them up, or your loyal workforce delivering them themselves.

There are very few jobs who will require a crate early into the round, so until something special happens or their progress gates are met, you'll have the pool of cash to play with all to yourself. This includes the Autolathe. While you start with no materials, Auxiliary Tool Storage is just a ten-second walk away and will keep the lathe running for quite some time if you get all the metal and glass.

## Crates For You

You start with quite a few credits, so here are some good first choices for the prepared Quartermaster:

- Insulated Gloves
- Engineering Equipment
- Metal/Glass
- Brute Medkits
- Standard Medkits

## Crates For Everyone Else

Eventually, you'll get a feel for what different people want. The Roboticist will almost always want either metal and glass, while the Virologist will perhaps want a Virus crate. The Bartender might want to borrow a circular saw for his shotgun, and the Botanist might want seeds.

One of the marks of a good Quartermaster is the ability to anticipate someone's order and have it ready for them. This often means keeping a stock of insulated gloves and welding masks (if you're the type to hand those out to certain people) and checking out who walks in. If you just hand out everything to everyone, you are a security risk. Use your own judgement - an Assistant should not have an RCD, but an Engineer definitely should. Likewise, the clown should not have a combat shotgun, but Security can have one if they want it.

# Tips

- If you're riding a MULEbot, you can't get facehugged.
- You can flip caps backward by right clicking them in hand or on your head. Don your trusty cap and tell the Captain to eat your shorts as you ride about on a MULEbot.
- Lethal projectiles can open crates, albeit slowly. Make use of a .357, the Bartender's shotgun, or any other projectile weapon to bust open Secure Crates.
- Packaging paper allows you to wrap things up and put them in your backpack when they wouldn't otherwise fit, like space suits!
- Listen to the Command channel, and respond accordingly. If there's rumors of a cult, buy Holy Water! If someone spaces armory, buy the HoS some shiny new guns!
