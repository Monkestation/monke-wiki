Welcome, Miner! You will break rocks, slay monsters, and die lost and alone in the depths of the caverns. Not on some sandy asteroid, but on what we call Lavaland!

Bare minimum requirements: Stay alive long enough to return your loot to the station. 

# Workin' In The Coal Mine

Being a miner can be somewhat tedious, but you serve a crucial role in the R&D food chain, and can accrue some decent personal rewards. Just follow a few guidelines to keep yourself from becoming dead in the mines.

Your workplace, Lavaland, has some hazards:

- Ash storms will cut right through your clothes, dealing constant burn damage if you are outside. A rain of dark particles outdoors indicate an ash storm.
- Lava - one step in and you'll be badly burned and on fire.
- Chasms - Anything that falls into one will disappear from this world.

The risk of these hazards can be reduced by watching your step and being aware of your surroundings. Don't walk into lava, chasms, or outside during an ash storm. You'll get a text warning not long before a ash storm is about to begin, so long as you stay near shelter (or have a bluespace shelter capsule with you) then you'll be fine.

You can click on an adjacent rock or run directly into it to begin picking or drilling the rock, but the Kinetic Accelerator is much faster and more efficient and you should be using that instead of a pickaxe or basic mining drill. Keep in mind that if you do decide to pick or drill your way through rock, you can have multiple dig jobs running at the same time to mine faster. The higher your mining skill, the faster you work with these types of tools.

## Working With Your Boss

Who is your boss? The Quartermaster, you idiot! He's the guy who probably told you to move freight and not die the moment you woke up. He's a part of the command staff, but he's also your greatest link to the station at large. If you need something, asking for his help over the radio is a good place to start.

## The Objective

You're here to mine, so get digging! Once you're full to bursting with ores, drag your ore box back to the station and head to cargo where the Ore Redemption Machine sits. Drag the box next to the machine to automatically offload your ores and have them instantly processed into sheets. Then click "claim" to retrieve mining points as a reward to your currently working ID. Now print new gear from the supply techfab and purchase new gear from the mining vendor, then take your crate and head back to Lavaland!

# How to Do This

Gearing up

- Gear up! From the mining equipment locker, you will need Meson Scanner goggles, a mining scanner, your pickaxe (optional), a bluespace shelter capsule (DON'T FORGET!) and your standard issue proto-kinetic accelerator. If you want, there is also an additional mining satchel, and a shovel for digging up ash (for glass).
- Attach your seclite and knife to your proto-kinetic accelerator to save space, and to let you bash things harder without having to take out your knife.
- Use your voucher on a mining vending machine to select your choice of advanced mining tools, listed below.
- Go to the Lavaland Mining Station and get an explorer suit, breath mask, and oxygen tank from Mining 'EVA'. On the western side of the base, there is a mini-Medbay where you can find first-aid kits, and a maintenance room where you can top off internals. The nearby storage room has more gear lockers and Ore boxes.
- Before you go, you'll want an Ore Box, which can hold an infinite amount of minerals. Ore boxes are available on the mining station, the mining shuttle and rarely on the field. More can be built with wood planks.
- For extra safety, grab a GPS device, set it to your name and tell the QM and other miners about it. If you're lucky, they will drag your lifeless body back to medbay. If you lack a GPS, there is a next to zero chance of being found and picked up by anyone that cares.

# Smashing rocks

- Find minerals. The further north, the better ore. Activate your scanner and shove it into your bag or internals box. Every once in a while it sends out a pulse that lets you see deposits in the rock a few tiles away from you. Try to get a mixture of every type of mineral.
- Pick up minerals by either having your mining bag in your belt slot or pockets, then just walk over the minerals. If you're dragging an ore box behind you, you'll automatically deposit minerals into the box instead of your bag.
- Once you've had enough, return to the main station with your Ore box. Do not deliver ore to the processing plant on the lavaland mining base, as that room is outdated.
- Miners have access to the science channel (with :n or .n).
- Drag your ore box to the delivery tile next to the ORM Ore Redemption Machine (usually north or south of it, depending on station). That'll automatically empty the box into the ORM Ore Redemption Machine.
- Take your mining satchel into your hand and activate it while standing on the same delivery tile next to the ORM Ore Redemption Machine. This will empty any ores in the bag into the ORM as well. Already processed sheets inserted into the ORM do not give any points. Only raw ores count.
- Click "Claim". You do not need to insert your ID.
- Go to a mining equipment vendor to buy advanced equipment with the points you've gained. Don't forget to stop by the department fab to build stuff

# Life beyond smashing rocks

- Use your better gear to push deeper into Lavaland.
- Print Advanced Plasma Cutters and Mining Satchels of Holding at the cargo protolathe for even more efficient mining.
- If science didn't print them, yell at them with :n or .n or go and ask at their front desk. It's hard to overstate how much these improve efficiency.
- If you feel robust enough, explore some ruins and die horribly get amazing rewards.
- If you feel VERY robust, look for Megafauna with your GPS and try to kill it, for extremely valuable loot.

# Voucher equipment

You start the shift with a complimentary mining voucher, worth one free item out of a selection of four. These items, and their strengths, are:

- Survival Capsule and Explorer's Webbing: The webbing (you put on your belt slot) allows you to carry even more mining equipment - having a second shelter capsule is nice too. 900 pts value.
- Resonator Kit: Comes with a resonator, and a mini extinguisher. 800 pts.
- Mining Drone: A little companion that helps in storing ore and hunting wildlife. Only useful once you install the sentience upgrade module. Comes with an upgraded industrial welding tool (80u), a welding mask and a KA modkit that allows shots to pass through the drone. ~800 pts.
- Extraction and Rescue Kit: Contains a fulton extraction pack and a beacon, which allows you to send back home minerals, items and dead miners without having to use the ferry. As a bonus, you get 30 marker beacons too. 1700 pts.
- Crusher Kit: Contains a proto-kinetic crusher and a mini fire extinguisher. The crusher is two-handed and hard to use without getting hit, but has a chance to make fauna drop powerful trophies. 800 pts.
- Mining Conscription Kit: A duffle bag full of basic items for one conscript - Proto-kinetic accelerator, survival knife, seclite, explorer's suit, mesons, mining scanner and satchel, gas mask, a supply radio key and a special card that adds mining access to IDs. Good for when you want to recruit metafriends fresh conscripts. 1500 pts.

## Mining Skill

Mining with certain tools will slowly increase your mining skill, making you faster at mining. If your skill in mining is greater than Journeyman you will also randomly see ores around you when using a mining tool.

## For Great Profit!

Mining for the sake of it can only get you so far. By mining minerals and returning them to the station you'll accrue mining points, you can then use these points to buy better and more powerful equipment and supplies from an equipment vendor. You can then in turn use these items to push further into Lavaland to mine more minerals, fight/battle stronger wildlife and find greater treasure. Consider it all an investment.

Survival Medipens can help you in a pinch for example, or a Wormhole Jaunter can help you escape what would have been a death trap. Or using Legion Stabilizer on Legion Cores, to let you save their heal and anti-slowdown effects for later. Or you can spend it all on booze and cigars. 

# Default Gear

The following is a list of default mining equipment:

## Essential Equipment

| Item | Description |
|----|---|
| Explorer Suit | This comes with a inbuilt hood. It provides some protection against  heat and cold, and works as decent armor with no slowdown. It is not  spaceproof, but can hold a full-sized oxygen tank or other mining gear.  You can also reinforce the suit and hood with up to 3 goliath plates. <br>Melee 30-60, bullet = 10, laser = 10, energy = 20, bomb = 50, bio = 100, rad = 50, fire = 50, acid = 50. |
| Explorer Gas Mask and Oxygen Tank | So you can have oxygen when mining. Oxygen tanks are available from  the tank storage unit, and can be worn on your suits storage slot. You  can also use your emergency oxygen tank which can be placed on your  suit. Running out of oxygen is unlikely with the full sized tank. |
| Meson Scanners and Automatic Mining Scanner  | Activating the scanner will briefly flash any ore on screen - it  works even inside a box. Can be used to stop gibtonite from exploding. |
|Global Positioning System, GPS | The crew monitoring console back on the station won't catch your  suit sensor signal from all the way down on the planet. Having one of  these on you will help others track down your body if you happen to  develop a case of the dead. In addition it can be used to locate other  miners (who bothered to take it) as well as "lost" signals. Megafauna,  necropolis tendrils, and certain ruins emit GPS signals. Be wary. Be  sure to set your name on the GPS. |
| Proto-kinetic Accelerator | A standard issue gun. The good part is that it packs a punch in a  low pressure environment, is very good at digging and has infinite  shots. The bad part is that it tickles in pressurized environments, has a  cooldown after each shot, and has a range of three steps. Can be dual  wielded on Combat Mode ### at the price of lower accuracy and speed. Alternatively, turn off Combat Mode ### and switch hands after every shot to get around the accuracy reduction. <br> <br>KAs deal brute damage (40 standard/10 in pressurized rooms), but  count as explosive versus armor. That way, suits like bomb suits and the  RD hardsuit can negate 90% of the damage dealt.   |
| Survival Knife | Use it for butchering the wildlife (hit corpse while on Combat Mode).  It's as strong against mobs as a pickaxe, but you can't mine with it.  You can store it in your boots to save space, but remember to alt-click  the boots to draw the knife back out. Alternatively, stick it on your KA. |
| Survival Emergency Medipen | A medipen for surviving in harsh environments. Heals most common  damage sources. WARNING: May cause organ damage. Takes 10 seconds to  inject and only injects half the reagents unless done in low pressure  environment, where it's instant. Contains 8u Epinephrine, 8u Aiuri, 8u Libital and 6u Leporazine. |
| Bluespace shelter capsule | Activate this in your hand, and it'll near instantly produce a  beautiful shelter. Ash storms do not hurt you inside, but wildlife can  break through the walls. The shelter contains a cupboard which contains a  guitar (or dice) and some donk pockets. It also has a stasis bed which  requires another person to use. Never leave home without one. You're  issued one for free in your mining lockers on station. |
| Ore Satchel | For carrying ore without using a mining cart, holds 50 ore nuggets. Empty it into boxes by using the satchel on them.<br>  Newbie tip: Put it in one of your pocket slots, then start dragging an  ore box. Any ore you walk over will be transferred to the box. |
| Ore box | Used for carrying huge amounts of ore. While a satchel can only hold 50 nuggets, this can hold an unlimited sum. You cannot carry it, but you can drag it with you.<br> <br>Use your satchel on the box to empty it into the box. Even better: Drag it behind you with an ore satchel in your pocket. |
| Mining Voucher | Found in your backpack, exchange this at the mining equipment locker  for one of several selections which include various mining items. |
| Seclite | A beefed up flashlight. Does 9 damage. Put this on your KA to free up inventory space. |

| Item          | Description |
|----------|---------|
| #<br>Pickaxe  | Somewhat antiquated thanks to the prevalence of the proto-kinetic  accelerator and resonator. Nevertheless it can be used to dig wide  tunnels, robust things in melee combat and as a backup if you lose your  resonator. It can also fit inside a belt chest webbing.  |
| #<br>Shovel   | Gathering sand. You can stick this in your backpack. A crappier version of a compact pickaxe |
| #<br>Crowbar  | For removing KA mods, or just in case when there is a blackout. Spawns in your box. You can of course use a KA with an empty hand to remove mods too.|

# Advanced Gear

The following are more advanced items that need to be purchased from a mining equipment vendor, with points:
## Voucher/Reward Equipment

These items can either be acquired from a voucher, or can be bought with mining points, usually earned from delivering ore to the Ore Redemption Machine Ore Redemption Machine on the station. Prices are included.

> Table is slightly out of date, does not include new Crusher weapons or other things such as possible points values tweaks. This will be changed when all info is verified.

| #<br>GAR Mesons                       | A pair of very sharp meson scanners. Can be thrown as a weapon, with a chance to embed. | 500 Points     |
| #<br>Chest Webbing                    | A storage rig fitted with many hooks, cables, pouches and pockets.  Can hold a wide variety of mining equipment. Fits in your belt slot,  think of it as a toolbelt for Shaft Miners. | 500 Points     |
| #<br>Survival Medipen                 | Contains several healing and heat-stabilizing chemicals. Using more  than one in a short period may cause overdosing. Takes 10 seconds to  inject and only injects half the reagents unless done in low pressure  environment, where it's instant. See contents here. | 500 Points     |
| #<br>Brute First-Aid Kit              | Contains bandages and brute-healing patches. | 600 Points     |
| #<br>Tracking Implant Kit             | Contains three tracking implants and a locator; useful if you want others to find your corpse for up to 10 minutes after death. | 600 Points     |
| #<br>Wormhole Jaunter                 | One-use item that instantly creates a wormhole to a random beacon on  station. The portal is unstable and will make you dizzy after using it.  Can be worn on the belt slot to prevent death on chasms. <br>The Jaunter is incredibly useful as an emergency escape tool when  your death may be imminent while fighting Megafauna. There is the  possibility that you'll end up in space surrounding the station. Better  hope you're lucky. | 750 Points     |
| #<br>Proto-kinetic Crusher            | A powerful two-handed melee weapon. Clicking ####  shoots kinetic bolts that don't deal damage, but can mark large  creatures making the hammer deal increased damage (20->50 Brute) when  used on them. It will deal even greater damage (80) on backstab.<br> What makes the Crusher special, is that enemies killed by it have a chance to drop trophies, powerful "modkits" that can be attached to the Crusher. | 750 Points     |
| #<br>Proto-kinetic Accelerator        | The classic mining weapon. Buy it from here if you lost your first one. | 750 Points     |
| #<br>Advanced Mining Scanner          | A upgrade over the default Mining Scanner. This tool has a much  larger detection radius of seven tiles (the entire screen), and updates  more frequently. | 800 Points     |
| #<br>Resonator                        | Another deadly tool. This will, when used on rock or an empty space,  create a field on that spot that lasts until detonated, causing serious  damage (60 Brute) to anything standing on/in/inside it. Has 2 modes:  Automatic detonation after 2 seconds, or manual which triggers after you  hit a field with resonator. You can activate it in your hand to switch  mode. Fields can chain detonate. Just like the kinetic accelerator, it  does reduced damage (20) in pressurized environments. Using it on an  already-marked spot will instantly rupture the field.                                                     | 800 Points     |
| #<br>Luxury Medipen                   | Cutting edge bluespace technology allowed Nanotrasen to compact 60u  of volume into a single medipen. Contains rare and powerful chemicals  used to aid in exploration of very hard enviroments. WARNING: DO  NOT MIX WITH EPINEPHRINE OR ATROPINE. Takes 10 seconds to inject and  only injects half the reagents unless done in low pressure environment,  where it's instant. Contains 10u Salbutamol, 10u Penthrite, 10u Oxandrolone, 10u Salicyclic Acid, 10u Omnizine, and 10 Leporazine. | 1000 Points    |
| #<br>Fulton Extraction Pack           | A balloon that can be used to extract equipment or personnel who are  outside (not within the station or the mining base) to a Fulton  Recovery Beacon. Anything not bolted down can be moved. Swap which  beacon the pack is aiming at by using the pack in hand. It has a limited  number of uses, examine the pack to check how many are left. <br>You can use it on yourself as a way to quickly return to the station,  though it isn't instant like the Wormhole Jaunter. If you have space in  your backpack, it will be stashed in your bag automatically when used  on yourself rather than dropping on the ground.   | 1000 Points    |
| #<br>Lazarus Injector                 | A miracle injection capable of reviving simple living beings from  death (AKA simple mobs), making them friendly to you and the crew.  Useless on humans, monkeys, and other complex living beings. Resurrect  Ian for all access from a thankful Head of Personnel! Or make yourself a  pet Goliath. The lazarus injector can be EMP'd to make revived mobs  hostile to everyone but you. Also useful for bartering with the HoP or  any staff with a pet. | 1000 Points    |
| #<br>Silver-plated Pickaxe            | Slightly better than the default pickaxe, but still a lot worse than your starting KA. | 1000 Points    |
| #<br>Mining Conscription Kit          | Contains a proto-kinetic accelerator, survival knife, seclite,  mesons, an ore scanner and satchel, an explorer suit and gas mask, a  supply encryption key and a card which adds mining access to IDs. | 1500 Points  |
| #<br>Space Cash                       | A thousand credits, to spend however you want! Useful if you want to  buy Goodies from cargo, or if you just want to shore up the station  funds. | 2000 Points    |
| #<br>Diamond Pickaxe                  | For when you want something shinier and better than your default  pickaxe and the scientists are either too lazy or too dead to make  drills or jackhammers. STILL worse than a basic KA. | 2000 Points    |
| #<br>Super (Upgraded) Resonator       | Like the regular resonator, but able to have 6 fields active at a  time - with no damage penalty for fields that are detonated early. Also  comes with a third mode: Matrix traps, which makes fields detonate when  someone walks over them. | 2500 Points    |
| #<br>Jump Boots                       | A pair of boots that allow you to jump over three tiles, skipping chasms. Does not prevent lava damage, however. | 2500 Points    |
| #<br>Luxury Shelter Capsule           | Tired of cramped shelter capsules? This is for you! Comes with a three-course meal, a deluxe companion and much more. | 3000 Points    |
| #<br>Luxury Elite Bar Capsule         | A luxury bar in a capsule. For when you have nothing else to blow all your points on. Bartender required and not included. | 10000 Points   |

| #<br>Super KA Chassis Mod             | A modkit that makes your KA look yellow, like one of the no longer existing Super-Kinetic Accelerators. | 250 Points     |
| #<br>Hyper KA Chassis Mod             | A modkit that makes your KA look orange, like one of the no longer existing Hyper-Kinetic Accelerators. | 300 Points     |

Combine with Cooldown modkits for maximum rock  destruction. | 2000 Points    |
| #<br>Mining Drone                     | This helpful little guy goes around collecting loose ore so you  don't have to. Will drop its haul when you hit it with the mining  scanner. Clicking on it with an empty hand will toggle it between ore  collection and wildlife fighting mode, where it will attack xenos with  its built-in kinetic accelerator and drill. Will not pick up sand with  no nearby ore around, for some reason. Comes with an upgraded welding  tool if redeemed via voucher. It cannot be repaired while it is  fighting. It can be further upgraded with special modules bought from  the vending machine to increase its effectiveness.   | 500 Points     |

# RnD Gear

The following is a list of advance items that can be acquired from your departmental techfab after research. 

| Item                              | Description |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| #<br>Mining Drill                 | Can be acquired early on from RnD. It's twice as fast as the  standard Pickaxe but is quickly superseded by better variants and is  expensive for what it gives. |
| #<br>Diamond Tipped Mining Drill  | Very powerful drill, able to almost instantly mine mineral walls. Very expensive in terms of Diamonds needed to produce however. |
| #<br>Sonic Jackhammer             | The epitome of mining. Can practically instantly mine through rock  and walls. But it requires three times the Diamonds of a Diamond Tipped  Drill. |
| #<br>KA Triggerguard Mod          | A modkit that will allow species that cannot normally fire guns to use the KA, such as golems and hulks. |
| #<br>KA Range Mod                 | A modkit that increases your KA's range by 1. |
| #<br>KA Damage Mod                | A modkit that increases your KA's damage by 10. |
| #<br>KA Cooldown Mod              | A modkit that reduces your KA's cooldown by 0.25 seconds. |
| #<br>KA AoE Mining Mod            | A modkit that makes your KA mine rocks in a 3x3 AoE. It does not,  however, deal AoE damage. You're usually better off carrying a plasma  cutter to deal with rocks and keep the KA for combat. |
| #<br>Plasma Cutter                | A fast mining (and welding) tool. Shoots rock-breaking bolts that  pierce up to 5 rocks per shot. Rechargeable by inserting plasma ore or  sheets into it. Less efficient in combat than a KA, however, and even  less when in high pressure.  |
| #<br>Advanced Plasma Cutter       | A very fast mining (and welding) tool. Shoots rock-breaking bolts  that pierce up to 10 rocks per shot, basically allowing you to pierce  rock as fast as you can walk. Rechargeable by inserting plasma ore or  sheets into it.               |
| #<br>Mining Satchel of Holding    | Very cheap mining satchel that can hold an unlimited amount of minerals and ore. |
| #<br>Night Vision Mesons          | These glasses work like normal mesons, but they can see perfectly in the darkness negating the need for flashlights in lavaland. |

# The Wildlife

Lavaland is filled with a variety of bloodthirsty alien lifeforms populating the caverns, walking just fine over the ponds and puddles of lava. Fortunately, you can fight them whilst taking minimal damage, if you have the know-how.

Useful items can be harvested from these creatures' corpses should you triumph; butcher them with a knife by attacking the corpse on Combat Mode and the goods will spill out! 

| Creature                  | Description | Threat               |
|---------------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| #<br>Legions              | Considered annoying at worst, and a free minor heal at best. These  creatures unleash legion skulls, one after another at you whilst trying  to keep a distance. Fortunately, each of its spawn dies in a single hit  (even a single punch), and deal tickle damage to you; the legion itself  can't directly hit you. It's best to go on the aggressive against these  with pickaxe in hand, advancing constantly whilst picking away each of  its brood. Once you've closed the gap or have it stuck in a corner, it's  toast. If you fall unconscious while you're being attacked, however,  you will instantly die and be turned into a Legion. <br> It drops a core when killed. Hit yourself with the core and it will give  you a slowdown immunity for a while and slight heal. Don't think you  can store these for later, though -- they will spoil after a few minutes  unless you use a stabilizer from the vending machine. However active  legion cores can be inserted into one's chest (as an organ) through surgery to provide a hands-free use of it, which will automatically activate if you fall into crit. <br> tl;dr strategy: Attack with your pickaxe/knife. Hack your way through  the legion and its heads until the host is mush. Alternatively, two KA  hits kill a Legion, or one KC mark detonation.   | Low                  |
| #<br>Watchers             | Fierce, territorial beasts capable of firing freezing beams, cold  enough to inflict serious freeze burns while the watcher closes in and  attacks its immobilized target. Fortunately, they don't attack unless  someone comes close to them, so if you don't feel confident, you can  just wait until you have a few more goliath plates, or maybe some  gibtonite. <br> Butcher a watcher for 2 pieces of diamond ore. Use your ore box for cover while shooting them with your KA from a distance. Alternatively, with a KC, close the distance before it shoots you, then alternate marking it and hitting it, and pop a survival pen afterwards. <br> Tip: Watchers are notably weak to explosions due to the nature of their  bodies, taking over half their health in damage from even the weakest of  explosions. | Medium |
| #<br>Lobstrosity          | A marvel of evolution gone wrong, the sulphur lakes of lavaland have given them a vibrant, red hued shell. Beware its charge. <br> Not much of a threat by themselves, they will try to charge at you to  knock you down and snip you if you get too close. Drops crab meat,  bones, and a rush gland when killed. The rush gland when implanted  letting you activate every 90s. It allows you to move at very high speed  for a short period of time. | Low |
| #<br>Brimdemons           | A misshapen demon with big, red eyes and a hinged mouth. Not much is  known about the creatures due to their response to any unexpected  stimulus being a deadly blood-laser barrage. <br> Stay out of their blood-laser barrage and do not face them directly.  Drops brimdust, which can be used as a botany reagent which heals the  plant, removes weeds and pests and increases potency. | Medium               |
| #<br>Goliaths             | The bane of many careless miners. These monsters carry a hefty  health pool, a mean wallop, and a deceptively dangerous ranged tentacle  attack. They are inherently resistant to lasers, so using a KA is the  best option regarding dealing with these. They move at a slow pace,  stopping every couple seconds to burrow tentacles under you. These will  trap you for a long duration if you stand on top of them for too long. <br> Fighting them is simple: Shoot, step back, shoot, avoid tentacles. Repeat this process until it stops moving. Alternatively, with a KC, get in mark range, mark it, run in, hit it, run out, avoid tentacles, repeat. <br> Butcher a goliath for its hide and its meat. Goliath plates can be used  to reinforce your hardsuit and helmet a maximum of three times, allowing  you to turn your suit into something closer to a piece of riot gear if  you hunt some Goliaths. The meat can be cooked in lava. | High                 |
| #<br>Necropolis Tendrils  | Huge spikes of organic matter, from the base of which crawl out  countless monsters. Each Tendril only spawns one kind of monster,  between legions, goliaths and watchers, every once in a while. The  tendrils themselves are fairly fragile and will die in a few well-placed  shots, if you can fight through the other mobs. Once killed, it will  drop its loot, shake the earth around it for a while, and then spawn a  huge chasm around it, destroying anything that did not get out of the  way in time. Chasms are deadly even after formation and should be  avoided. <br> Fighting them can involve killing all its protectors patiently, or using  tactics like gibtonite. Either way, once killed, ignore the remaining  monsters, grab the chest, and RUN.  <br> When killed, they spawn necropolis chests which can contain a variety of  useful artifacts, that usually cannot be found anywhere else. See the  table below for the possible loot. | Medium to Very High  |
| #<br>Goldgrubs            | Mostly harmless and quite rare. These creatures swallow up any  loose, valuable ore they can find and flee when approached by a human,  smashing through even solid rock on their path of escape before  burrowing into the ground. A tactic toward killing one is to throw an  ore towards it, and quickly charging in to kill it while it's busy  eating, but note that kinetic accelerator shots do nothing against  these. Their skin is reflective, requiring a pickaxe melee smackdown to  ensure a kill. <br> When killed, they spit up multiple pieces of ore, based on what they  ate. Feed them many different types of ore before killing them, and  they'll spit out more of each type than you gave it! Just don't let it  get away after spooking it. | None                 |
| #<br>Megafauna            | Extremely big and powerful creatures, that randomly spawn in lavaland. Each one of these emits a GPS Signal that can be tracked with your own GPS, to either seek or avoid them.<br> <br>To beat them and get their valuable loot, you must either have good  equipment or be VERY good at dodging their attacks, as failure usually  means not only death, but gibbing as well. <br> Their slow speed means that you can usually outrun them, although you should be careful of not letting them hitch a ride in the mining ferry, as the station has very few weapons that can damage megafauna. | EXTREME              |

# Shiny Mobs

| Creature                    | Description | Threat    |
|-----------------------------|-------------|-----------|
| #<br>Dwarf Legion           | On the rare occasion that a human with dwarfism falls to a legion,  they can become infested like any other. Dwarf legions have 20 less  health but move slightly faster. <br> It drops a soul, the exact same soul as dropped by the normal legion. <br> <br>It's still rather harmless. 2 KA shots kill it, a couple of pickaxe swings will knock it out. | Low       |
| #<br>Magmawing Watcher      | Whenever a shiny watcher appears, (which is a 1% chance), there's a  75% chance that the mutant is going to be a magmawing watcher, and a 25%  chance that it is going to be an icewing watcher. When raised very  close to lava, some watchers adapt to the extreme heat and change  coloration. Such watchers are known as magmawings and use intense heat  as their tool for hunting and defense. The magmawing watcher shoots  scorching blasts instead of freezing blasts, which heats you up and can  set you on fire. <br> Unlike normal watchers, a shot from this watcher will set you on fire,  and trying to roll it out will only result in the watcher getting more  free shots on you, which means that you're pretty much forced to man up,  pop a survival medi-pen, and melee it to death while you lose half of  your HP to fire. (Or you know pour water over yourself, someone else or more simply, use a  fire extinguisher or a pocket fire extinguisher)<br> <br>It has normal watcher loot. It's really simply just not worth fighting.   | High      |
| #<br>Icewing Watcher        | Whenever a shiny watcher appears, (which is a 1% chance), there's a  25% chance that the mutant is going to be an icewing watcher, and a 75%  chance that it is going to be a magmawing watcher. Very rarely, some  watchers will eke out an existence far from heat sources. In the absence  of warmth, their wings will become papery and turn to an icy blue;  these watchers are fragile but much quicker to fire their trademark  freezing blasts. The icewing watcher has 50 less health and fire shots  33% more often, as well as dropping 5 diamonds and no sinew <br> It's a beefed up watcher which is more tanky and shoots more often.  Treat it like a normal watcher, except you have to get into cover a bit  quicker each time. <br> <br>It has normal watcher loot, but drops 5 diamonds instead of 2, and drops no sinew. | High      |
| #<br>Ancient Goliath <br>   | Goliaths are biologically immortal, and rare specimens have survived  for centuries. This one is clearly ancient, and its tentacles  constantly churn the earth around it. Tentacles constantly extrude from  the ground around it, even when it is not aggroed to any particular  object. <br> It is recommended that you clear an area around the ancient goliath so  that you can take shots at the ancient goliath without getting snagged  by the tentacles. Once you've done that, just run circles around the  thing while shooting at it, and dodging any emerging tentacles. <br> <br>When killed, they drop their goliath hide directly, more can be obtained through butchering. | Very High |

# Necropolis Chest Loot

Necropolis Chests are guaranteed whenever you destroy a tendril or a pulsating tumor. They also drop from the Legion megafauna, when you kill a Stage 3 skull. NOTE: you MUST use an empty hand on the tendrils and drag the crate away before it collapses or you WILL DIE.

| Name                                 | Description |
|--------------------------------------|-------------|
| Paradox Bags                         | A pair of bags with a linked storage: anything that is put in one can be pulled out of the other and vice versa. |
| Soulstone                            | A soulstone much like the kind used by a Blood Cult  or by the chaplain on MetaStation, except it can be used multiple  times. When used on a corpse it disintegrates it, and traps the soul  inside the gem. The soul can then be released as a weak ghost bound to  the will of the soulstone's owner, or it can be put into a construct  shell, if you somehow own one. |
| Cursed Katana                        | A cursed katana for ninja enthusiasts. It deals 15 damage to  unarmored targets. It is a retractable but irremovable organ, when you  obtain it out of the tendril chests you have to use it in your hand. #  But it's cursed, and it mauls your hand if you retract it without  attacking a live target. Able to do combos (viewble by examining it  twice), and has a lower attack cooldown when attacking fauna. |
| Eye of God                           | A strange eye. It can be worn on the glasses slot to gain the  ability to scan targets to reduce their attack speed, along with night  and meson vision. |
| Flight Potion<br>("Strange Elixir")  | A bottle containing 5 units of flight potion. Ingesting flight  potion will turn the drinker into an angel: a human with wings. Wings  allow jetpack-like movement wherever there's air when activated, also  giving increased speed and free movement over tables and chasms. You  lose your back slot as an angel.<br> <br>It only works when drinking at least 5 units, so do not dilute or split the content. Does 20 brute damage when drinked. |
| Cursed Heart                         | A cursed heart. When used, it grants fast regeneration, but it must  be pumped manually at least once every 3 seconds and one second early to  account for lag. Screen turns red if you miss a beat and lose 100u of  blood but gain 50u every successful pump. Warning though, there is no  warning except by medical scanner on how close you are to death. Before  use I recommend that whoever uses this has a blood bag ready for  transfusion and a medical scanner to keep an eye on your blood level.  |
| Ship in a Bottle                     | When used, spawns a Mysterious Boat, which can travel over lava without need for oars. |
| Berserker Hardsuit                   | A hardsuit coming from a Khorne Berserker Champion. It has no  slowdown, is immune to magic and ash storms, by getting damaged in it  you gain berserk charge, which you can use to start attacking incredibly  fast with a lot of melee armor while losing your ability to fire guns. <br>melee = 30, bullet = 30, laser = 10, energy = 20, bomb = 50, bio = 100, rad = 10, fire = 100, acid = 100 |
| Sord                                 | An unbelievably shitty sword. |
| Dusty Shard                          | When used, spawns a power miner bound to you. The type is chosen at random. |
| Red/Blue Cube                        | A pair of cubes. When one is used, it teleports the user to the location of the other cube, with no cooldown. |
| Wisp Lantern                         | A lantern containing a wisp. When used, it releases the wisp, making  it orbit around the user's head and granting it thermal vision and  serving as a light source. It can be returned to the lantern by using it  once again. The lantern does not otherwise need to be carried or  protected for the effect to persist. |
| Immortality Talisman                 | A magic talisman. When used, it makes the user invulnerable but  immobile for ten seconds. Being invulnerable does not protect from  instant death effects such as singularities or point-blank bombs. Has a  60 seconds cooldown. |
| Instant Summons Spellbook            | A spellbook that grants you Instant Summons. When first used, it  binds the item currently in your hand; every time it is used after will  teleport the linked item (and any container it should be inside) to your  hand. |
| Book of Babel                        | Instantly teaches you all languages. One time use only. |
| Jacob's Ladder                       | A ladder that extends all the way to a different Z-level. |
| Lifesteal Crystal Modkit             | A mod kit that, like the name suggests, steals life from enemies you attack. Comes with a free cult blankie! |
| Memento Mori                         | A necklace that once equipped links your life to it. You cannot die  while it is equipped but if removed turns you into dust. Seals your  guardian spirits while you're in crit (-100%). <br>Note: Megafauna are the exception and will still turn you into gibs if you're knocked into critical condition. |
| Rod of Asclepius                     | A rod that can be used to make yourself start swearing an oath. If  you finish the oath, the staff will bind to your hand, giving you a  healing aura and pacifism. You will also gain the ability to perform  multiple surgeries at once. |
| Concussive Gauntlets                 | Jackhammer in the shape of gloves, for fast mining without needing to hold any tools. |

Crusher trophies

Each time you kill a Lavaland enemy with the Crusher, there is a chance that it drops a trophy. These can be attached to your Crusher for unique effects. 

> Note that some items are currently missing from this table. Info will have to be pulled from game code/practical gaming to get the table brought standard with all the various crusher trophies available, to include those from Megafauna and items no longer available due to the removal of certain enemies.

# Craftables

Not only can you kill the local fauna, you can also cobble together items from their smashed remains. Open the crafting menu for this. 

> There's more goodies available from lavaland enemy crafting than what's currently listed, such as the bone fishing pole. More to be added.
{.is-warning}

| Item                   | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|

To get  leather, strip goliath hide with your knife, wash it in the sinks on the  mining base, then throw it in the microwave. <br>ALSO: It goes in your bodywear slot, like a spacesuit or the explorer  suit. It can go in the cloak slot, but provides no resistances. melee = 35, bullet = 10, laser = 25, energy = 10, bomb = 25, bio = 0,  rad = 0, fire = 60, acid = 60   |

# Xenoforms

You're not always the only sentient being on the planet. Aside from the lovecraftian horrors living down there you may also content with several groups or factions of beings on the planet. Some hostile, some friendly.

The follow is an incomplete list of all known sentient groups found on the planet based on information sent from recon squads.

## Podmen

Recon Expedition #4
Threat Level: Severe, Non Hostile
Note: A small group of podmen were observed living inside a sealed vault. They appear heavily armed with unbranded revolvers but seem to avoid leaving their home.

## Golems

Recon Expedition #9
Threat Level: Minimal, Non Hostile
Note: A unidentified flying object was seen crashing by Recon Team Charlie during expedition #8. Alpha team on expedition #9 located a group of golems, the golems appeared utterly uninterested in their surroundings all things considered.

## Ashwalkers

Recon Expedition #13
Threat Level: Medium, Mixed hostility
Note: It appears a group of Basiliscus Lizretus, also known as Lizardmen, live on the planet, they are hostile to all intruders, but don't seem to frequently attack us without provocation. These 'ashwalkers' only started to appear when mining operations started, they are agile but lightly armed, wielding primitively forged armor and spears. They appear to also have a hostile relationship with the wildlife, having been observed killing and dragging wildlife corpses away, as to why they need these corpses the recon team is unable to ascertain.

## Syndicate Agents

Recon Expedition #45
Threat Level:Extreme, Hostile
Notes: It has come to attention that the syndicate (direct corporation/group unknown) has recently set up a large compound in lavaland. This may explain where expedition #38-44 has gone. They are equipped with high end weaponry and has been stated that trace bits of gunpowder has been found around the lava moat that the base is stationed in, suggesting that this base may be wired to self-destruct. We also detected radio waves coming and going from the compound. If found, turn back and report to your superiors immediately.

## Dust bums

Recon Expedition #42
Threat level: I'm not even sure, dude
Note: These bros are surfed up, brother. They run that high tide with a buffed joint, y'know? They make a cocktail that's out of this WORLD. They can't really leave this place without our help, but why would they want to leave? They're pure calm, got some good drinks, some good snacks, even a few botany trays... I'm going to grab a glass of water. 

# The Ores

These are what you should be looking out for, generally try and get a good mix of the more exotic ore types. Iron ore is ok but it sells for little and is highly abundant on the station already.

| Name               | Wall  | Raw Ore  | Money Reward Value  | Processed Ore  | Frequency    | Uses |
|--------------------|-------|----------|---------------------|----------------|--------------|-----|
| Iron               | #     | #        | 1                   | #              | Very Common  | For just about everything. |
| Sand               | #     | #        | 1                   | #              | Very Common  | For making glass, which has a plethora of station applications.  Activate sand in your hand to make sandstone bricks. These can be used  to make dirt which can be used to grow plants. |
| Plasma             | #     | #        | 15                  | #              | Common       | Ship sheets back to Centcom for bonus money to the cargo budget. |
| Silver             | #     | #        | 16                  | #              | Semi-Common  | Making dosh, mechs, and researching Bluespace. |
| Gold               | #     | #        | 18                  | #              | Semi-Common  | For making various electronics or pimping out Beepsky. |
| Titanium           | #     | #        | 30                  | #              | Uncommon     | For high-tech mechs or R&D components. Also for building shuttle walls and floors. |
| Uranium            | #     | #        | 30                  | #              | Uncommon     | For making you radioactive (notice: no joke, this shit is deadly as a wall or a door). Delicious cocktails. |
| Diamond            | #     | #        | 50                  | #              | Rare         | For making mech parts, among other industrial uses. |
| Bluespace Crystal  | #     | #        | 50                  | #              | Rare         | These crystals can be used in various ways. Give them to science to  increase bluespace science, hold onto them to use as a risk free  jaunter, or throw them at people to make them teleport randomly (often  into space.) |

Hitting it with your mining tools will start a chain reaction. If you  don't stop the reaction with your mining scanner in time, the gibtonite  will explode. If you do, you can mine the ore, pick it up (you need both  hands free) and use it as an explosive. The closer the gibtonite was to  exploding before defused, the more potent its power. Cannot be forged  or turned in to the Ore Redemption Machine , so don't bring any of this to the station or else you'll be ~~arrested~~ ignored by security because they don't know what the hell it is. Gibtonite can be used to craft a Chemical Payload . <br> <br>How to obtain Gibtonite: Hit ore, count to 8 flashes of the ore then  hit it with your scanner. Gibtonite varies in the number of reactions it  has, so you may get lower quality ore. Use 2 of the 0 reaction ores  (the most potent) to blow open the AI core and make it cry at it's ~~malf~~ failure! **NOTE: CURRENTLY NOT SPAWNING FOR SOME STRANGE REASON** |

## Who Needs What

Long gone are the days of miners delivering refined materials to the various departments by hand (or the crew coming directly to cargo for themselves), thanks to the introduction of the Ore Silo's bluespace storage system -- but it never hurts to know what to aim for.

- Scientists need at least a bit of every ore to fabricate new parts and to complete material scan experiments. In exchange, they may research upgrades for your Kinetic Accelerator, a Plasma Cutter, a Mining Satchel of Holding, and, if you're lucky, Night Vision Meson Scanners or a Bag of Holding!
- Roboticists need diamond, uranium, silver and gold for building mech parts and equipment. Give them enough and you've indirectly helped out most of the departments on the station if the Roboticists are competent enough to build helpful stompy mechs for everybody! If you feel like mining with your own stompy mech, get a Clarke and reap the profits.
- The Quartermaster may want mineral sheets to trade them in for bonus supply credits. Plasma in particular is both common and valuable.
- Medical Doctors and Station Engineers need uranium, titanium, silver and gold for a number of their higher tech equipment, once the R&D gets the tech for advanced tools and higher end biotechnology of course.
- Everybody could always use more iron, glass and plasteel, but especially Roboticists (cyborg shells cost a surprising amount of metal) and Station Engineers (basic construction materials for just about everything).
- The Chemist and Xenobiologist will all appreciate having extra plasma.
- A competent Virologist can use several sheets of uranium to create incredibly powerful healing viruses that let you heal out of crit in two seconds.
- A Clown with Bananium is a grateful and dangerous ally.
- The Bartender can use a few sheets of uranium or iron to craft some of his rarest cocktails.

## Secrets of Lavaland

While on Lavaland, you may come upon artificial structures. They can have items ranging from magical artifacts, to other lifeforms, to artifacts of great honking potential. If you are at all unsure, always let your mining buddies know using :u or .u before going in; some ruins can be very dangerous.

## Gas Mining

Ore isn't the only valuable resource that you can find in the depths of lavaland, after all! On certain rare shifts , the lavaland atmosphere will be filled with valuable gases for selling! It's recommended to have an atmos tech or engie support you, as miners aren't provided the tools needed to harvest gases straight out of the air. Often, they'll ask you to deploy your Aux base landing designator so they can bring a large harvesting platform down. This is one of the ways you can substantially support cargo as a miner!

# Tips

- Always go with at least two other people when mining. Not only can you mine faster together, the chance that they could both be 'lings/traitors is rather low. Pickaxe to the skull tends to put down most people.
- You can view the contents of a mining satchel as if it were a backpack. If more than one of you interact with a tendril before it collapses, you can even nag some free chests!
- Minebots are great at distracting monsters. Just walk near and bash the distracted target with your drill. They can take quite a beating, though goliaths can take them down pretty quickly if you're not quick enough. Plus they collect all the crap gibtonite left.
- The Proto-kinetic Accelerator can destroy electrified grilles without needing a pair of insulated gloves.
- The Proto-kinetic Accelerator will obliterate a space carp in one hit while in space.
- The Head of Personnel may reward you with all access if you resurrect Ian. Also, sometimes the Research Director will reward you for a pet gold grub.
- If you're expecting trouble on the station, consider taking out a window on the mining shuttle before you return to make a quick getaway so you're not trapped like a rat in a cage.
- The mining drone can be repaired with a welding tool, but not in the middle of a fight. A goliath will always win in a one on one fight with a mining drone.
- You could alternatively buy the drone, fully upgrade it, give it an AI Module, and tell it to go valid-hunt. A mining drone dragging a bar of soap is surprisingly robust against even changelings.
Life improving things:
- Mining suit upgrade : Goliath plates add +10% melee resist each time when applied to a suit. The plates will stack until they reach 30%, which may help you live in case a goliath grabs you.
- Security Jumpsuit : This gives a +10% melee resist to everywhere but your head. Nag the QM or HoP to give you one.
- Augmentations : Augs are VERY useful for miners, as healing with a welder is ultimately easier. Plus they work differently than armor when it comes to protection, instead reducing all brute damage taken by an augmented body part by 5 (4 for burn). Also they are ashproof. If you get fully augumented, you are ash storm proof. Downside : EMP vulnerability.
- Kinetic accelerators can be used as infinite tools to navigate space, since every time you fire, it'll throw you in the opposite direction.
- Sentient minebots can very easily be commanded to go help security if there is an imminent threat to the station. Their melee saw is very robust, and works just as well as on the station as it is on lavaland. The proto-kinetic accelerator that they are equipped with is very robust when in space.
- If science hasn't researched Advanced Mining Technology and Applied Bluespace Technology within 15-20 minutes of the start of the shift, please remind them. There is normally at least 1 single person in science competent enough to do so. Also remind SCI/ENG to upgraade the ORM if they want tons of materials.

# Dead Space

A traitorous miner has a lot of advantages. You have a decently armored suit and gun for free right away, use them! Certain minerals you'll find have more "specialized" uses -- uranium structures will irradiate people, plasma can start fires, gibtonite goes boom, and bluespace crystals let you teleport. You can also buy dangerous "mining" tools and possibly even revive those monsters you've been fighting. In addition, Lavaland is isolated, dangerous, and as expansive as you're willing to dig out. Plenty of room for somebody to get lost in... Forever! Once you've learned to slay the large fauna of lavaland, you are one of the largest threats to the station. Megafauna loot along with items like luxury pens and regenerative legion cores mean that you far outclass nearly any crewember's gear in combat.

## Tips for Traitoring

- If you're a miner and you have to kill another miner; there's a really easy way to block communications one way so he can't call for help.
- Grab a multitool, go to the mining communications room.
- Use the multi tool on the relay and make sure the relay isn't sending, meaning your headset won't go to people on the station.
- Kill your target with their shouts for help unheard.
- Uranium structures, while nowhere near their former glory, can easily deny an area of people for a long amount of time. To some extent, the same is true for plasma.
- Tiers 0-1-2-3 can gib bodies, remember mining suits take 50% of damage away from bombs, so strip miners you want to make disappear forever first.
- Ripley is a fairly robust murdering tool, if you can, convince robotics to put a gravity catapult on it. SLAM PEOPLE INTO WALLS. THE SUFFERING NEVER ENDS.
- Space is your best ally. Your weapons are more lethal in space, and anyone who wants to chase you will need access to a jetpack and EVA gear. Make people fight on your terms by blowing up the station with various Gibtonite charges, or bust in, stun and drag targets into space.
- You can make a chemical payload container using any shitty bit of gibtonite. This can be useful for making chemical bombs, but it relies on knowing how to obtain specific chemicals that can be robust and accessible to a Miner.

## Tips for Culting

If you're a miner, Mining Station is the perfect hive for a cult. The back room can easily be broken down by Constructs, runes can be placed, and a single artificer can make it very difficult for Security to try and raid. Remember to cut cameras, so a Non-Asimov AI doesn't bolt and electrocute every door. Remember to use Teleport other to get Cultists off station and into safe custody. Warning: Teleporting from Lavaland will make the destination rune glow brightly and open a rift in reality that may not only reveal the rune, but the location of your base as well.
