## Main 
Nanotrasen staff inevitably end up hitting their heads on something really hard. Could be some greytider swinging a toolbox, or worse, a subversive brainwashed by the Syndicate. Or it could be a Shitcurity officer, his baton swinging gracefully in an arc. Or well, they could've just ran into a pair of titanium-plated swinging truck nuts strapped to the underbelly of a Durand. Either way, they could possibly end up with a brand new friend! Well, a friend in that they're chained in the same dungeon as it. One must admit that it's a lot better than the other options though... 

When someone gets severe brain damage (that means brain damage >100), they have a 20% chance of rolling a Special Trauma. Of the possible traumas within the Special Trauma pool, 5/8 are positive, although a Mild Trauma usually comes along as well. Included within this pool is the chance of obtaining an Imaginary Friend, manned by a ghost, often unwillingly. 

### Objectives
As an Imaginary Friend, your objective is to advise your host as to various affairs, and to keep your host from dying. Sometimes it can be simple, on other occasions, you have to walk your host through an entire interrogation by security. Your secondary goal is to keep your host's special trauma from being cured, as that means that you "die" along with it. 

### Abilities

Because you are a construct of your host's (now rather deformed) brain, you can only telepathically communicate with your host. Outside observers do not have to ability to understand the conversations that you have with your host. You do not have the ability to influence anything in the real world. You can detach from your host as a free-roaming spirit, and travel within a nine tile radius of your host. That's actually a freer range of motion than you would first think! Although your host can watch you moving around, everyone else cannot. You can pass through walls, and snoop in to conversations. As a result, you are rather useful as a scout, and for warning your host about a dangerous situation, such as a plasma fire. You are also an invaluable asset to any sort of Antagonist, as with your information, your host can easily run around security.

If your host looks like they're about to take some Neurine, yell at them with all your will not to. Even though Special Traumas almost always come in conjunction with a Mild Trauma, the benefit of having an Imaginary Friend far outweighs any consequences from a Mild Trauma, no matter how annoying it may be.
