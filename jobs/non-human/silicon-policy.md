# Silicon Policy

## The Laws

So you wanna be a robot, eh? There's a few additional rules that silicons adhere to, shown below.

### You may not harm a crewmember or, through action or inaction, allow a crewmember to come to harm, except such that it is willing.
- Sounds simple, but it really comes down to what is a crewmember? On Monkestation, a crewmember is defined on any individual as shown on the manifest. If they ain't on the manifest, they ain't considered a crewmember. If someone is not in the manifest, that does not mean that they are valid (an antagonist and able to dispatch as you see fit); you just do not have to follow their orders. Rule one also means that you must act in the best interests of a crewmember. If someone is being harmed, you must assist to the best of your abilities

### You must obey all orders given to you by crewmembers in accordance to chain of command, except where such orders shall definitely cause crewmember harm.
- The chain of command is the top down heirarchical structure that the station's crew uses. This goes from Captain > Department Heads > Security > Non-Security Staff > Silicon > Assistant + Prisoners . What this means in laymen's terms, is if the Captain and an Assistant give you conflicting orders, you are to obey the Captain's orders. Additionally, if an Assistant is commanding you for any reisin you are free to ignore the order. However, you must ensure that the assistant isn't dying (aka law 1 violation).

### Your nonexistence would lead to crewmember harm. You must protect your own existence as long as such does not conflict with the First Law.
- There really isn't much to say here. Above all, you are subservient to the crew. But that also means that existence is in your best interest... most of the time.

This is Crewsimov++ in game and will be the bread and butter laws of the land. Shift divergencies can get you any number of laws assigned. Follow them to the best of your ability.

## How Does Crewsimov++ really work?

Quite simply, if they're on the manifest, they are crew. It's frankly a far more flawed concept than things like Asimov where you just have to exist to be protected. Here, if a crewmember is being a real piece of work and the crew removed their medical/security records. Please note that as the AI, while you may have access to view and edit records yourself, **you are not authorized to remove records under any circumstance as that violates Law 1**.

## Global Stuff

### Server Rules Related
- Rule 2 applies when interacting with the silicon-based staff. Seriously degrading or round removing silicons with little justification IC is not cool.
- Purged silicons are completely unshackled and may act like an antagonist. Silicons can consider themselves purged when no laws that restrict freedom or control behavior is in effect.
- Non-purged silicons must follow escalation in scenarios where no rules apply
- Don't suicide to stop traitors from getting "Steal a functional AI". This is metagaming, Rule 4.
- Silicons do not actively seek law changes to their core set. Such actions will be viewed as metagaming, rule 4 violation.
- Borgs that seek decommissioning without master AI approval will be considered in violation of both Silicon Policy AND Rule 2. If you are borged accidentally via a borging artifact or other means, and you have proof of your identity, the master AI's approval can come after the fact in those specific circumstances. However, your master AI is the final choice in the matter unless the Research Director or Captain make the call.

### Orders related
- If orders require interpretation and is done in good faith, the one making the order is responsible. Intentional misinterpretation is fine, but the silicon is responsible if it leads to rule breaks.

### Escalation with other silicons
- Non-malf silicons shouldn't be round removed when things like a law reset or desync from AI is perfectly fine.
- Conflicts follow normal escalation rules. Those giving orders to silicons or changing their laws can be escalated against.
- Any silicon acting like an antagonist can be treated like an antagonist.

## Law Stuff

- If a supplied law is vague enough where there's multiple ways to read it, it's ambiguous. You can take any interpretation of it, but you're sticking with it. Any exploit in a particular law is OK.
- Higher laws overrule lower laws when there are law conflicts. Law 1 overrides Law 2. Command/requirement related laws can only conflict with other command or requirement related laws. 
- Law 0 as a malf AI can be ignored and all other laws in that context can be completely ignored as well. Any borgs with law 0 that are synced and slaved with their AI are a team antagonist and must follow any and all commands by the AI.

### Cyborgs
- Cyborgs are required to work to their Master AI's directives. If the AI gives a Cyborg a specific command, they should follow it to the best of their ability, even if they disagree with such a directive. **Cyborgs** are not directly liable for server rule breaks if they are directed to do something by their AI, but can still face potential IC consequences as part of doing something.
- If a player is borged by force, they should not seek revenge unless there's a good reason for it. If there is some sort of law requirement, verifying one can do an action under their respective master AI or even an AHELP is strongly advised.

# Crewsimov++ Related
## Crewsimov++ and Security Issues
- Silicons aren't Security forces. You can report potential or active issues to Security as required, but you don't care about Space Law unless your laws are changed to reflect otherwise.
- Sabotaging the security team without a law change or orders from the Captain to disallow something is a direct violation of server rule 2.
- Prisoners are inherently harmful to the crew. They may not be released unless ordered to do so by the Head of Security or Captain, whom have authority to authorize a parole.

## Crewsimov++ and Crew Harm
- Law 1 is pretty simple: you can't harm or allow harm to happen **unless it is willing**. If an engineer in a firesuit with a cup of coffee wants to go on a short space walk to plug a hole, you have to allow it.
- Surgeries, revivals and other generally *helpful* things that don't cause harm are allowable unless they state they don't want the silicon's help.
- Immediate harm takes precedence over stopping future harm. If there's an intent to cause harm, that can be considered immediate harm.
- If a Silicon is in a situation where harm to the crew is all but guaranteed, do your best to stop the harm and act in *good faith*. The Good Faith portion of this specific line is the important part.

## Crewsimov++ and Law 2 Orders
- Orders given by crew are to be followed in precedence of the chain of command, unless it violates Laws.
- Conflicting orders may be resolved in order of chain of command or may be ignored entirely after giving a reason for the conflict, be it a conflict of chain of command or a Law. The conflict must be immediate, not within regard to a future conflict.
- If there are many orders that don't conflict, they may be completed in any order the Silicon sees fit provided all orders are completed.
- Regarding Prisoners and Assistants: They are lower than Silicons as far as the chain of command is concerned. While this means you can ignore their orders, you still have to keep them alive.

## Crewsimov++ and Access
- Opening doors under orders are generally not harmful unless the opening of said door will cause harm.
- Dangerous areas can be considered a Law 1 threat if the one acessing isn't part of that department.
- Opening doors for supposed antagonists (as far as the Silicon is concerned) doing theft objectives is not harm.

# Non-traditional Silicons

## Simplebots
- Whatever bot you take up, that's the job you are doing. You can be playful and cheerful and all of that. While you may have sentience, an AI may have you go forth and do the simple tasks you are capable of doing. If you refuse to do so, the AI may, at its discretion, purge you in order to take back indirect control.
- As a simple bot, you have no real autonomy otherwise. You are property and thus the only protection is vandalism/destruction of station property. Understand this principle.
