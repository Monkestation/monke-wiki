# Ghost

So you've tried to fight THE MAN and lost, eh? Never fear, you are now a ghost! You've probably already noticed you can go through walls and jump to people and shit, pretty cool huh? Well, guess what, you can't do anything else. Yeah, to be honest, the only "good" thing about being a ghost is that you can randomly become an Alien when some silly gentleman has a bad encounter with a facehugger.

### Travelling to the Astral Plane
The "ghost" command allows you to become a ghost, whether you are dead or alive. CAUTION! Ghosts can re-enter their body (assuming their body isn't gibs or ashes) if they ghosted after death, allowing that body to be cloned if anyone ever finds it. However, if you ghost before you die, your body will appear as "catatonic" and can't be re-entered or cloned.

Once you're a ghost, odds are you're going to stay a ghost until the end of the round. But never fear! Besides being chosen to be an alien, ghosts may also become pAIs or adamantine golems if the right mortal beings seek you out (and your game settings allow it)! If the gods are especially playful, you might even get the chance to become something else! 

### Dead Chat

Dead chat is considered to be both OOC and IC, so feel free to talk about anything bitch about that shitty-ass player you hate here. 

### Now where's that disk gone

Ghosts have 6 basic commands in their HUD, if enabled:

- Spawners Menu: Lets you look at ghost role available things. If nothing is in the window, there's nothing to jump into.
- Orbit: This will show a list of all sentient mobs and points of interest to choose from. Picking one will teleport you to it and make you start orbiting it. PoI include the nuke disk, the nuke, ghost role spawn locations, gang dominators, and so on. Double-clicking any element will also cause you to orbit it.
- Re-enter Corpse: Will cause you to go back inside your corpse, if you still have one. Very important when being revived, as normal methods usually won't work iff you're not inside. This also makes you go back to your body if you're using a Blood Cult Astral Projection rune or a Wizard's scrying orb.
- Teleport (to location): Gives a list of areas, allowing you to teleport to any of them. Useful for z-level crossing, as without this you can't watch CentCom.
- pAI candidacy: Allows you to make yourself available for download as a pAI. Upon clicking you'll be able to edit your name and description, which the people looking for pAIs can check to decide who to download.
- Minigames: Lets you vote to join in on CTF, Mafia and Basketball

A lesser-known command, not in the HUD, is "observe", which can be found in the ghost tab. Using it works similarly to orbit, but it will show you the perspective of the observed person, along with their HUD.

### High-Definition Observation

Ghosts have a few tools to observe every move of the living with maximum comfort.

- Toggle Darkness: Don't let a simple lack of light prevent you from seeing those maint-stalkers!
- Toggle Sec/Med/Diag HUD: Turns on every HUD at once!
- Toggle Chem Scan: Lets you check people for chems like you're using the health analyzer!
- Toggle Health Scan: Lets you check people's health like you're using the health analyzer!
- Toggle Gas Scan: Lets you check tiles the same way you would using a gas analzer, but remotely!
- Change View Range: Having ascended from your mortal coil, your sight is no longer limited to seven meters; use this verb to expand your horizons. Or reduce them if you want to for some reason.

### Ghost Roles

Lavaland, and to a lesser degree, space, can sometimes spawn special ruins containing ghost role spawners. These objects can be clicked as a ghost to spawn as a special neutral role such as the free golems or the ashwalkers. These roles are in a grey area between antagonist and station crew; the rule of thumb is usually to not commit antagonistic acts unless threatened, except for ashwalkers, which are intended to be somewhat hostile to other lifeforms. Every role can have additional rules which are explained in bright red text upon spawning. And remember: you do not remember your past life, so using a ghost role to get revenge will lead to a ban.
