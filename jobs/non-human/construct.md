## Main 
Soul stones are commonly located with the occult or magic, such as [Cultists](/jobs/antagonists/blood-cultist) and [Wizards](/jobs/antagonists/wizard). They can be used to build up an army of loyal servants.

Shades and constructs are slaved to their masters will. They must follow the orders of their master at any cost. They are capable of grasping intent, unlike synthetic beings. Shades as well as any constructs are EVA capable and can maneuver in space without outside aid. Should they die, they leave behind ectoplasma which can be used to make ghost-burgers. Constructs created by cultists automatically become cultists themselves, allowing them to identify their team mates, and even count for the escape objective. Clever crewmen who steal soulstones and shells can create their own constructs to fight the cult.

Some constructs have special abilities, which can be used similarly to mime, changeling and wizard abilities via the tabs on the right side of the SS13 interface. All constructs are immune to being stunned, but similarly, their attacks have no stun chance like regular attacks.

All constructs have the ability to scribe specific runes, however with a 3-minute cooldown.

### Soulstone Shards

Soulstones Shards (or simply Soulstones) are used to house souls. They can be used to release said souls, into the form of a shade. A Soulstone can be used on a dead or living human in critical condition (Providing the soul is still inside the body) to load his soul into said stone. From here, the soul can only speak in Nar-Sie tongue, but the master can momentarily release the soul and it becomes a shade or it can be inserted into a construct-shell to be made into one of the various kinds of constructs.

Soulstone shards can be purified by anyone with a Bible in hand that isn't in a Blood Cult. This will cleanse any contained shade from evil and will cause them to take on a white appearance, and will no longer be sided with the cult. These purified soulstone shards can then be put into construct shells, to create special crew-friendly purified constructs.

## Shade

- HP: 40
- Damage: 5-12 (0 vs. structures)

Shades are fragile and their average damage output per hit is relatively poor (albeit still better than that of an artificer), but they move very quickly, they can ventcrawl, and being recaptured into a Soulstone shard Soulstone.png heals them.

- Fun fact, humans can pull shades (no, not like that, you sick fuck).

## Artificer

- HP: 50
- Damage: 5 (60 vs. structures, can one-shot non-reinforced walls, heals constructs of same alignment for 5 HP per "hit" instead of damaging them)

The artificer is the "drone" of the cult. It can construct cult-floors, walls, and reinforced walls, as well as take apart the station (it can break a non-reinforced wall with a single melee attack!), but its main purpose is to provide the materials to construct additional constructs. It can create new soul stones and shells with its innate spells. In addition to that, it can heal itself and other constructs (for 5 damage per "hit") by "attacking" them. Note that purified artificers cannot heal cult constructs, and cult artificers cannot heal purified constructs.

### Spells
- Summon Cult Floor - This spell constructs a cult floor under you.
- Summon Cult Wall - This spell constructs a cult wall.
- Greater Conjuration - This spell constructs a reinforced metal cult wall.
- Summon Soulstone - This spell reaches into Nar-Sie's realm, summoning one of the legendary fragments across time and space.
- Lesser Magic Missile - This spell fires several slow-moving, homing, magical projectiles at nearby targets that will stun them and deal 10 damage on a hit. That includes cultists, so beware.
- Summon Revive Rune - This ability, which is technically not actually a spell, creates a revive rune if you stand still for 6 seconds after activating it.

## Wraith

- HP: 65
- Damage: 20 (40 vs. structures)

The wraith is a tiny bit more fragile than a human but has a strong melee attack. The Phase Shift spell, similar to a wizard's Ethereal Jaunt spell, allows it to become temporarily invisible and immaterial, giving it immunity to most attacks and the ability to travel through walls (while the spell is active). Note that a wraith cannot attack while phase shifting. This construct is the bane of the AI, as the stationary AI core is usually defenseless against them.

The wraith can lower its jaunt cooldown by attacking:

- 1 second on normal attacks
- 5 seconds on critting
- Full refund on kills

### Spells

- Phase Shift - This spell allows you to pass through walls, similar to the wizard's ethereal jaunt.
- Summon Teleport Rune - This ability, which is technically not actually a spell, creates a teleport rune if you stand still for 6 seconds after activating it.

## Juggernaut

- HP: 150
- Damage: 25 (90 vs. structures, can attack one-shot non-reinforced walls)

Juggernauts are strong, slow, and have lots of health. They can destroy any non-reinforced wall by simply punching it and do more damage than Wraiths. They cannot be pushed or grabbed and even have a Shield spell that is similar to the Force Wall wizard spell (unlike the wizard spell, however, no one can freely walk through the shield, even people with antimagic or the juggernaut who created the shield). Additionally, Juggernauts are immune to all melee attacks that use weapons that have force values of 10 or less (such as fire extinguishers and (unsharpened) kitchen knives), and even have a chance to reflect lasers and beams that hit them (they will still take half damage from projectiles that they reflect, however).

### Spells

- Shield - This spell creates a temporary forcefield to shield yourself and allies from incoming fire.
- Gauntlet Echo - Channels energy into your gauntlet - firing its essence forward in a slow-moving but devastating blow.
- Summon Barrier Rune - This ability, which is technically not actually a spell, creates a barrier rune if you stand still for 6 seconds after activating it.

## Harvester

- HP: 40
- Damage: 15-20 (40 vs. structures, 0 vs. carbons)

Harvesters will only appear after Nar-Sie has risen, and they have one goal: To bring you screaming and kicking back to Nar-Nar. Their attacks deal no damage to carbons (humanoids (including inorganic ones), monkeys, xenos, etc.), but each attack will take off a limb, eventually nuggeting their victim. If you have no dismemberable limbs left but DO have at least one undismemberable limb remaining, they will be able to deal damage to you directly, even if you're a carbon. Once you have no limbs (or no will to crawl away), they will drag you back to Nar-Sie to become a harvester yourself.

Harvesters have two abilities, one is an area convert that turns a small area of effect around itself into cult material, and the other one is a shield to block humans from escaping their grasp. Finally, they (and the victims they drag) can go through cult walls, so they will use their area convert to pass through obstacles to get to you.

### Spells

- Area Conversion - This spell instantly converts portions of a small area around you into being made of cult-themed materials. This ability can convert walls into runic walls, allowing harvesters to pass through them.
- Shield - This spell creates a temporary forcefield to shield yourself and allies from incoming fire.

## Purified Constructs

Any non-cultist can use a bible on a cultist or wizard soulstone shard to purify it, turning it blue. Putting a filled purified soulstone shard into a construct shell will create a blue angelic version of an ordinary construct. These will be loyal to the crew and have abilities similar to the non-purified versions. A purified artificer will be able to produce purified soulstone shards and ordinary construct shells. Any purified construct can destroy runes by attacking them.
