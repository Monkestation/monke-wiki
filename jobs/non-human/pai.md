## Main 
Personal AIs, or pAI for short, are potentially the one individual you can truly count on in SS13. They are similar to a carded AI, in that they fit in your pocket and don't really possess much of a body of their own outside of an immobile device you carry around. They cannot wirelessly control doors and machines around them like a carded AI can. Instead, they possess a unique suite of abilities with which they might serve their master. Whom they serve is determined at the DNA level, allowing whoever holds an unbound pAI device to imprint their own unique enzymes to the device. Typically, the only way to unbind a pAI from its master is to wipe the personality completely, which resets the DNA imprint and makes the device a blank slate once more. pAIs are players, like you! They're player-controlled, and are pulled from all active observers in the round. 


### How to get one

Most stations are pre-equipped with PAI devices at the start of a round. Some common locations include dorms, the library, science lobby, and even space ruins! If those are all taken or you need more, you can print some with iron and glass after Basic Robotics Research from the sci techfab. 

### How to use one

Pick up the device with an empty hand and activate it in your hand. If any ghosts have already submitted personalities (in character descriptions of their personality and OOC comments) then you can simply pick one and download them! If none are available, or you don't like any of the options, you can request more personalities. This sends out a prompt to the ghosts to submit a personality.

### Dealing with an unsatisfactory pAI

Sometimes things just don't work out. Maybe the personality you chose doesn't fit your playstyle. Maybe the player playing the pAI has unexpectedly disconnected. Maybe the pAI is being intentionally antagonistic, ignoring directives, or interpreting them in a way you don't appreciate. The solution is simple: wipe the personality. This can be done in much the same way you downloaded it to begin with. Simply choose "Wipe Personality" in the device settings window. Now the device is free of the old personality and a new one can be requested as normal. This forcibly ghosts the player playing the wiped pAI, and allows them to observe the round as normal (they are capable of re-applying to be a pAI as well.) 

### Bots

You can also put your pAI into simple bots which they can then control. Do this by unlocking the robot with a valid ID, and then clicking it with the pAI in your hand. pAIs cannot go into ED-209s or Securitrons (for balance reasons), but they can go into Medibots, Cleanbots, Floorbots, and Honkbots. They can not be inserted into cyborgs or mechs. 

### Holograms

pAIs can choose to manifest themselves into the outside world through a customizable hologram. Whilst they cannot interact with items, they can be used, for example, to attract attention to your dead master.

### How to be one

At any point as a ghost, you can press the PAI button at the bottom of your screen and write up a personality! While filling all fields isn't required, it does increase the chance that you are picked by the other players. You do not need to wait for a personality to be requested before submitting!

### pAI Software

pAI's have a selection of software they can download to try and aid their master. You start with 100 memory, which is plenty enough to take most abilities. Note: Once software is downloaded, you are stuck with it unless you suicide, so choose carefully! 

|   Software Package    | Function | Memory Used  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|  Atmospheric Sensor   | Analyzes the gasses in the local atmosphere. Useful if your master is an Atmospheric Technician. | 5 |
|     Crew Manifest     | Lists all known crew members' full names, as well as what occupation  they're registered as in the station records. Do not mistake it with  the crew monitor! | 5 |
|   Digital Messenger   | Allows you to send PDA messages. Now you can REALLY be a personal Secretary, sending messages for your master! | 5 |
|  Photography Module   | Take pictures, just like a camera would. This comes with zoom  settings, an internal photo storage and a printer. Unfortunately, you  cannot see the images without printing them out. | 5 |
|    Encryption Slot    | Allows you to speak in secure channels, if you have the required encryption key. | 10 |
|   Music Synthesizer   | The crew are usually too busy to play music, and that's where you come in! Synthesize any instrument to play any Song you desire. | 10 |
|      Newscaster       | Lets you access the Newscaster network. Unfortunately, you cannot upload pictures that you take with your photography module. | 10 |
|    Remote Signaler    | Allows you to send a signal, with a code, on a frequency of your choice. | 10 |
|       Host Scan       | Lets you scan the health of anyone that is holding you in their  hand. On top of that, it also allows you to scan your master's health at  any distance. | 10 |
|      Medical HUD      | Gives you the medical overlay. Especially useful to help your master avoid any disease in the case of an outbreak. | 20 |
|     Security HUD      | Gives you the security overlay. If your master is innocent, it helps  to avoid any dangerous criminal. If they aren't, it's crucial to know  whether security is aware of their evildoing. | 20 |
|     Crew Monitor      | Allows you to see, in real time, the health status of the crew's suit sensors. A paramedic's best friend. | 35 |
|       Door Jack       | A tool that allows you to hack open an airlock. When activated, it  will pop out a data cable that needs to be connected to the airlock.  After that, you can start the hacking process. This takes a while and  also alerts the AI.  | 35 |
|     Internal GPS      | Useful if your master is exploring space or Lavaland. Note that only YOU can see the GPS, so you will need to relay the information to your master. | 35 |
| Universal Translator  | Speak and understand any language! This includes weird ones like Pirate or Alien. | 35 |

*Directive Guidelines*:

"Recall, personality, that you are a complex thinking, sentient being. Unlike station AI models, you are capable of comprehending the subtle nuances of human language. You may parse the "spirit" of a directive and follow its intent, rather than tripping over pedantics and getting snared by technicalities. Above all, you are machine in name and build only. In all other aspects, you may be seen as the ideal, unwavering human companion that you are."
"Your prime directive comes before all others. Should a supplemental directive conflict with it, you are capable of simply discarding this inconsistency, ignoring the conflicting supplemental directive and continuing to fulfill your prime directive to the best of your ability."

## Tips

- If your master gets cryoed, if you are with him you can insta-eject him in case doctors forget him.
- It shouldn't have to be said, but don't holoform away from your master unless ordered to! Being a PAI means helping out another player, not just getting another chance to play by yourself.
- You can shove a PAI, active or inactive, into your PDA to save space!
