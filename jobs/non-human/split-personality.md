Sometimes, a normal concussion isn't good enough. When a spaceman exhibits enough brain damage for the dent embedded within the top of their head to collect rainwater, there's a good chance that their brain gets bisected along with it, creating two personalities. With a lack of cooperation, a Split Personality can turn existence hell. With a good amount of cooperation, one can actually turn it into almost a net positive, with tasks being delegated accordingly. Well, if RNG is cooperative in letting each player take the wheel. 

When someone gets severe brain damage (that means brain damage >100), they have a 80% chance of rolling a Severe Trauma. Of the possible traumas within the Severe Trauma pool, there is a 1/11 chance of rolling complete lobe separation, in other words, a Split Personality, manned by a former ghost. 

### Objectives

As a Split Personality, your first goal is to make sure that your body survives. Other than that, you share the same goals as that of your host. Was your host a Head Revolutionary? Great, now start flashing people. Was your host a Traitor? Great, now try to help achieve their objectives. If your host is a law-abiding member of the crew, stay that way. Any suicidal behavior, A:, is not fun for your original host, who might have invested a good amount of time into achieving things, and B:, is probably going to end up with you getting bwoinked.

Also, make sure that your host doesn't try to cure the "complete lobe separation" brain trauma that is keeping you in existence, as if they do cure it, you'll be completely deleted. It usually should be a severe or greater trauma, so neurine should be okay for your host to drink (check with a health analyzer to make sure that your host's "complete lobe separation" trauma has a "severe", "deep-rooted", or "permanent" prefix in front of it before drinking neurine, though, just to be safe) to cure some of their lesser, more annoying traumas.
