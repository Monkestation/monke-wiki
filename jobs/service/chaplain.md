# Chaplain

| | SERVICE STAFF |
|:----:|--------|
| \[ job_image ]<br>Chaplain | Access: Chapel office, Morgue, Crematorium, Theatre<br>Additional Access: N/A<br>Difficulty: Easy<br>Supervisors: ~~You are above earthly concerns~~ Head of Personnel<br>Duties:Hold services and funerals, cremate people, preach, deal with heresy, etc<br>Guides: [Blood Cult](/jobs/antagonists/blood-cultist), Religion, Sects<br>Alternate Titles: Priest, Preacher, Reverend, Oracle, Pontifex, Magister, High Priest, Imam, Rabbi, Monk|

As a chaplain, you would ideally proselytize whatever crazy religion you've made up for that round over your headset. However, besides your office, the hellish crematorium next to your office, and the rarely used morgue, you have no access.

It is vital that you use the radio to call people to the Chapel, because otherwise, it is less frequented than the Library.

Bare minimum requirements: Hold a funeral if someone asks. Cooperate with security in the event of a cult. Follow your religion.

# Holy Artefacts

In your possession are several important items, including your Holy Book and the Null Rod. These items are powerful and should be kept in your possession at all times.

# Holy Book

You have to set the name of your god and religion in the Character Setup window before the round starts, else you will be stuck with whatever the default is. The first time you interact with your book in a round, you can set its skin. The resulting Bible starts with a bottle of whiskey, and perhaps some other junk; you may want to store the holy water on your desk.

Hitting somebody in the head with your Bible has a 60% chance to heal them and a 40% chance to give them 10 brain damage unless the victim congregant is wearing robust headgear (helmets, and any child of the helmet class, including space helmets.) You can even revive people who are in critical condition! Be careful, depending on the skin you've picked for your book, there may be additional effects! (The flaming skin sets flammable substances on fire for example, specially ones your target is covered in while you try to heal them).

It should be noted that your book cannot be used by the non-believers, meaning: If someone steals your book and attempts to brain somebody over the head with it, the book will sizzle in that person's hands. However, others CAN access the content of the book itself. 

Armaments beacon

This remote allows you to drop in a box with select chaplain-y clothes. The armor values are all 50 melee, 10 bullet, 10 laser, 10 energy, 80 acid, 80 fire (Same as the Riot Suit) except for the "Followers of the Chaplain" kit and the "Divine Archer" kit.

- Templar - Standard templar armor, Deus Vult! (Fun fact, deus vult means "Gods Will." and Deus Lo Vult for "God Wills It")
- Stone Sentinel - An ancient guardian statue armor.
- Profane Scholar - A student robe and a head cage.
- Witchhunter - A witchhunting garb and hat.
- Followers of the Chaplain - A cult leader hoodie and 4 follower hoodies. Make your own cult!
- Divine Adept Kit - Adept robes and hood. The ideal outfit for burning the unfaithful.
- Forgotten Kit - Old clock cult armor and helmet.
- Divine Archer Kit - Divine archer's garb, coat with a hood, boots and bracers. Has lower armor values than other armor sets: 40 melee, 5 bullet, 5 laser, 5 energy, 60 acid, 60 fire.

## Mysterious Old Book of Cloud-Chasing

This is a black book that teaches one person the spell "Smoke"

## Null Rod

The obsidian rod will be your defense against the forces of evil. Having it in your possession will make you completely immune to the effects of cult-related magic. It will also destroy any runes/sigils and is an excellent weapon in general.

You can transform it into a holy weapon of choice by using it in hand! Options are:

| Icon  | Name                                                                 | Benefits                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Drawbacks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

# Sects

Sects allow to change the mechanics for the Chaplain. You may choose to sacrifice your ability to heal carbons to heal synthetic limbs and charge cyborgs, or maybe increase the amount of heal by sacrificing money on each thanks to the Greedy God's 'favors'.

You may also get tougher with the teaching of the Sparring God, or join the maintenance dwellers and be a holy space hobo.

# Duties

Each chaplain is free to invent the details of their rituals.

- Funerals: You have a stock of coffins and burial garments you can use for wakes and space burials (that is, launching them out of the mass driver). Some employees appreciate wakes being held for friends and loved ones. See below.

- Psychological care: This includes counseling, pharmaceutical remedies (consult the chemist), and confessions. You have a confession booth; you and the confessor enter separate rooms and switch on the radio terminals. Most crew members rarely if ever submit to psychological care of their own initiative; offer to help when someone looks troubled. Prisoners are most often in need of attention.

- Church Services: Give sermons and sing hymns.

- Proselytizing: Most crew members are godless heathens; acquiring followers for your god(s) is your first priority. When you convince someone to join the church, you can perform a ritual of conversion (some elements you may want to include: drugs, glossolalia, sacrifices, drinking of demon's blood, public announcements, prayer, lying naked on the altar, strikes with the holy book, confession, blood-letting).

- Blessing Rooms: Your bible has the power to turn ordinary water into holy water by blessing smacking the container with it. Holy water stops any Evil Spirits or Magical Beings from Ethereal Jaunting onto the tile that you splash the holy water on, and can deconvert cultists. If a cult or wizard is discovered then it would be the best idea to bless a water-tank with your bible, give that to security, grabbing a fire extinguisher and blessing that too and then asking for the AI to let you in so you can bless his chamber from potential harm. The fire extinguisher will allow you to easily bless rooms because it will affect every tile that the water travels on. You can tell if a tile is blessed when it glows yellow after a little while.

- Other possible activities: Investiture of new acolytes and paladins, dedication of mechs, gravitational singularities, psychical research and seances, and pilgrimages to the singularity/Clown Planet/the AI Satellite/the Derelict Station.

## Thanatology

The Mass Driver's primary purpose is for burials-at-space; wooden caskets are provided for this purpose. Caskets function likes lockers; place the body in the casket, give a eulogy (over the radio if no one is present), move the casket into the driver and fire it.

Note that some crew members may seek to use the Mass Driver as a way to exit the station into space; for safety reasons, make sure they are adequately equipped before letting them through. This will send them towards the derelict station.

The Crematorium is used to turn bodies into ash, including those of xenos. Remember to strip the body before cremating it.

## Propitiating the Gods

The Pray command is like an adminhelp, but is IC, and should be worded deferentially (e.g., "Oh Great and Wise Pelor, please grant your humble servant...). It is advised that you only pray later in the round; the gods have a habit of ignoring early prayers. You can increase your divine favor by making a sacrifice to your god(s) of choice; you can do this any number of ways (it is wise to state what you have sacrificed in your prayer). Prayers are more likely to be answered if they are somehow thematically appropriate: wishing for an RCD for no apparent reason is unlikely to be fulfilled, but performing an elaborate ritual to your chosen god may be more favorable!

You have candles and crayons in your locker. Candles can be set anywhere and lit (they eventually burn down). Crayons can be used to draw runes (commonly placed in front of the podium), as well as graffiti (not really your style) and letters (allowing you to write out messages across the ground).

Do not expect any prayers to be answered. Gods are fickle beings. Nobody knows what they are going to do next in their great designs.

## GET BEHIND ME ~~NAR-NAR~~ RATVAR

During a cult invasion, you will suddenly find yourself a vital part of the station's security force, and also a target. You will want to ensure Security has a stock of holy water to deconvert cultists -- remember that your bible can bless any water it comes into contact with -- and Security may want your null rod as well. Your bible can be used to detect nearby hidden runes by hitting the floor with it. This can be invaluable in finding suspected cult bases. Finally, you are immune to cult magic, which will help you if you decide to go BATTLE PALADIN and valid save everyone. For more information, go here.

If your god hates you enough, you may also encounter a Revenant, an undead ghost creature that wants your souls. Again, your null rod is incredibly robust against these creatures.

# Tips

- You can use your starting bible in your hand to change its sprite.
- Alternative sprites include a Quaran, a white Bible, a clown bible, the Necronomicon and more!
- Your bible, despite starting with some useless junk, can be emptied and filled with a complete set of tools or other similarly sized items only one small item because coderbus hates fun. Best of all, it fits in your hoodie's suit storage!
- Healing en-masse during blob rounds is extremely effective, as you can get people back into the fight quickly and easily. Besides, who needs proper cognitive function to fight the blob?
