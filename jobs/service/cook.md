You are the less-alcoholic half of the Maltese Falcon.

You cook food, blend veggies and fruits, grind bodies for meat, stick monkeys and xenos onto meat hooks for meat. And kill people who mess with you, with your kitchen knife.

Bare minimum requirements: Make sure there's always some food on your counter, in case a hungry crewmember comes by. 

# Equipment

The first cook to join the shift starts with a speckled coat, a nice maid jumpsuit, and a cool chef hat like in those movies. Any other cooks that join later will have a cook's apron and a white cap. Cooks get a lot of cool kitchen related things, too. Depending on the station, you get some number of:

- Silverware vending machine.
- Microwave.
- Griddle
- Oven
- Smart Fridge.
- Deep fryer.
- A hallway-facing counter with shutters.
- Rolling Pin.
- Grinder.
- Food processor.
- Meat Spike.
- Gibber.
- Ice cream cart.
- Eggs.
- Meat.
- Flour.
- Rice.
- Sugar.
- Universal Enzyme.
- Whetstone
- Training in Close-Quarters Cooking.
