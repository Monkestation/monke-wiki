## Your BOOMSTICK

Your shotgun is double-barrelled. It can hold two shells at once and fire both in quick succession. Clicking it in your hand will break the shotgun, causing the shells inside to fall to the floor. It starts loaded with two beanbag shells, and you start with extra ones in your bag.

You can get more shells using cargo's autolathe.

- Rubbershot shells (green) fire in a burst of 6 pellets dealing 3 brute and 11 stamina per bullet

- Beanbag shells (green) fire 1 bullet and do ten brute damage and 55 stamina

- Shotgun darts (purple) do five brute damage but can be loaded with up to 30 units of any reagent to inject on being hit with

- Incendiary slugs (orange) deals 20 brute damage and sets the target on fire.

Autolathes can create circular saws, which you can use to saw off your shotgun so it can fit in your bag. If you do this while the gun is loaded, it will go off in your face.

Science can also research Technological shells, which you can use to create different types of Shotgun ammo via the crafting menu, such as Meteorslug shells, Pulse slug shells, Dragonsbreath shells, and others.

## Your bottles

Your bottles are a powerful multi-purpose tool. Whether it be for drinking, splashing on people via throwing or smashing. Depending on the chemical or booze mix you fill your bottles with, you can have bottles that are very useful for healing, robusting or flat out annoying people via throwing them, smashing them on people's heads or forcing others to drink from them. You can also load your personal collection of bottles onto a tray to carry more bottles than a cardboard box would be able to carry and it's easy access to your bottles if you put the tray on your belt. If you put your bottle tray on your belt, you could quick-equip from your belt by pressing the "Quick-equip belt" hotkey and sling bottles before your opponent could even react. Here are things you can do with your bottles.

- Synthflesh-filled booze bottles heal people instantly on splash depending on how much of it is applied via throw, sure they may be toxin damage in the aftermath, but Tea and it's iced variant could help heal the toxin damage.
- With access to a pepper spray refiller at a Security checkpoint, you can make bottles filled with Condensed Capsaicin that will knock someone down and blind them for quite a long time on throw, but only if they're skin is exposed upon throwing these bottles at them.
- Having a Fluorosulfuric Acid and Sulphuric Acid factory going into your bar's back-room could allow you to make bottles that deal heavy amounts of damage to the unarmored and melt the equipment of the armored so you can throw your Condensed Capsaicin bottles at them.
- Ever wanted to play a cruel prank on your crewmates? get some space ants from rotten food, scoop 'em up, make an ant factory, then fill your bottles with ants or itching Powder before throwing them at people.
- Buy the deputy vest and hat from the Theatre, cosplay as a wild-west bottle-slinger and try to become the quickest hand in Space
- Give the clown some Condensed Capsaicin bottles since he ran out of pies and the Cook can't be asked to make more.
- Give pepper spray booze bottles to Security so they can quickly arrest anyone not wearing pepper spray protection.

# Tending to your Bar

You have a whole bunch of spirits in your handy Booze-o-mat vending machine, with which to mix all manner of drinks. The Vodka in your Booze-o-mat cures some radiation, and Screwdriver can efficiently purge radiation in engineering staff.

Difficulty is minimal, but bar fights can get deadly if your most valued patrons are too drunk to intervene. People also love to murder people having a good time in the bar, especially if you start serving Beepsky Smashes. 

# Human Controlled Pun Pun!

Is that NPC Pun Pun too boring for you? Well now you can turn someone into Pun Pun! First take Pun Pun to genetics and get him scanned in those fancy machines. You want to scan UI+UE and SE. Inject the victim willing participant with the SE first and wait til he becomes a monkey. Second inject him with the UI+UE and tada! Player controlled Pun Pun. Take him back to the bar and have him dance on the table tops for space cash. The old Pun Pun can be given to the chef to quench the evil desires of that wretched machine of his.

Alternatively, you can get a Mind Magnification helmet from Cargo and put it on Pun Pun or another monkey to make the monkey controlled by another player, picked from ghosts.

If you want to communicate with the new Pun Pun be sure to get a pAi. If your monkey friend is too quick to leave you don't fret! Monkeys can be handcuffed, so just handcuff him to chair. Now he can NEVER LEAVE! 

# Beyond The Booze-o-Mat

The chemist has access to, and will usually readily give, most of the chemicals you could want for drinks. In addition, many chemicals have tastes and effects on their own, and can be added to drinks to create flavor/effect combinations that are impossible with just the booze-o-mat and dispensers. For example, thermite tastes like sweet metal, and chlorine trifluoride tastes like burning- both creating delicious drinks that are also serious weapons or tools when thrown. 

# Tips

Several drinks you can make will have actual effects OTHER than getting people sloshed. To name a few:
- Beepsky Smash is a fairly easy to make (You'll need Iron from Chemistry) incredibly easy to make (just get iron from the ORM) drink, which when ingested provides an immediate and incredibly powerful stun while also forcing the victim to stand still.
- Milk Cream, Orange Juice, Lime Juice, and Tomato Juice all heal small amounts of brute, oxygen, toxin, and burn, respectively.
- 'Nothing' and Banana Juice will heal Clowns and Mimes of all damage types at a decent rate
- Carrot Juice can heal eye damage
- Cream, Milk, Soy Milk, Cafe Latte, Soy Latte and Chocolate Milk all have 20% chance to heal 1 brute, this can roll multiple times at once. It's recommended to get a cow immediately.
- Remember to ask the Janitor for wood and cleaner grenade beakers if he hasn't already used them. You can use the Fluorosurfactant to make a keg-stand worth healing for.
- Dr. Gibb can prevent people from getting drowsy, nostalgic Chemists who like Chloral Hydrate will love this being delivered to them.
- Temperature issues? A handful of drinks can either cool you down or heat you up!
- Lemon-Lime, Iced Tea, Iced Beer,Thirteen Loko, and Space-Up will all chill you
- Antifreeze, Sbiten, Soy Latte, Coffee, Chocolate, and the elusive Toxins Special will all warm you up
- There are quite a few other drinks with special effects - Experiment and mix them all into an omni-cocktail!

## Traitor Bartender

- An emag can make a Syndicate Caf√© sign when used on your bartender screen... Useless but good to know, right?
- Neurotoxin is more potent than Chloral Hydrate - If you can find a way to apply it, your victim will spend a very long time on the floor
- Beepsky Smash makes someone incapable of holding items in their hands. Mix this with your poisons to completely debilitate your targets.
- You can knock somebody down by breaking a bottle of alcohol over their head (Any of the several in the Booze-o-Matic), provided they aren't wearing robust headgear. This also drenches them in potentially dangerous fluids -- cover them in something flammable and use a lighter or welder to ignite, or douse them in acid in deal heavy damage. This works with all chemicals, so get creative and experiment.
- The Bartender's damp rag can be used to smother people. Soak it in a chemical to transfer 5u to it. Then click someone on Combat Mode Combat 32.pngHarm 32.pngHelp 32.png. Doesn't work if they have their mouth covered.
- Slipping a pill into a drink creates an obtrusive message, but can still be an effective way to transfer chemicals without somebody noticing. Make sure the glass isn't full!
- With a Toxins Kit and some Shotgun Darts your shotgun can become one of the deadliest weapons on the station, with a 1-shot kill that deals upwards of 150 toxin damage in less than 30 seconds
- If you can find a chem dispenser you could make !!Fun!! potassium and water darts that are as !!Fun!! as they sound.
- Even without darts, the toxins kit is incredibly strong - 20u of Polonium is very lethal, as are many of the other chemicals
- Throwing Acid mix-filled booze bottles at people can be immediately lethal to the unarmored. Throwing Condensed Capsaicin and acid mix-filled bottles make things even worse since the only armor that fully protects against those bottles do not protect from being smashed in the head with those bottles.
