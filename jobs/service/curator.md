# Curator

The Curator spends most of their time in the library printing out a lot of copies of The Lusty Xenomorph Maid or running around in their red suit and welding through walls of everywhere they have no access (i.e. everywhere). The library itself has a permanence to its contents from game to game on the servers -- all properly uploaded books can be downloaded in any other round.

This is more bane than blessing, since several titles that never should have seen the light of day are forever mingled in with literary classics shamelessly plagiarized from the internet, and also a lot of H.P. Lovecraft. Ba-zing!

Bare minimum requirements: Learn how to write and publish books. Know how to navigate the library computer GUI. 

# Welcome to the exhibit!

Sadly, you will not go on cool adventures to obtain magical artifacts. You will be giving out books, on the rare occasion that someone requests a book.(See Below) You will also occasionally have to replace the Chaplain's bible, after he beats one too many people with and is disarmed and the book spaced. The final area of your job is to upload new books to the archive (See Below). So, take your pen and paper, and write down some screenplays! Printing a few books is cool, but don't be a dick and print 100 copies of one. All it does is crash people that right-click that pile.

# The Curator and his Library

First things first, stock your library with books that matter. At the start of the station, your bookshelves will be EMPTY! Your fellow crew members will not want to stay in a library that has no books. To fix this use the Library's Check In/Out Computer's and use its function, "4. Connect to External Archive". Here is the main dish of your sum total of existence, to sort out in the mess of books, and find only the BEST. The books are not sorted, or sortable, and look to have no order what so ever. You will even find many books' copies in the archive. To retrieve the selected book, simply click ORDER, the Check-In/Out Computer's printer will hum as it produces a completely bound book. How did it do that?

The barcode scanner will be needed for checking books into the local library's computer. It has 4 settings, as follows:

Mode 0 : Scan book to local buffer.
Mode 1 : Scan book to local buffer and set associated computer buffer to match.
Mode 2 : Scan book to local buffer, attempt to check in scanned book.
Mode 3 : Scan book to local buffer, attempt to add book to general inventory.

# How To Add A Book To The Database

- Get Paper and a Pen.
- Write your love story about those Lusty Xenos on the paper.
- Take your story to the East Back of the Library to the Book Binder.png Book Binder, and slap that epic story onto the binder. This will spit out your new award winning story.
- Still have that pen? Good, you can sign your name, add more content, and even title it.
- This book is ready to be send though the Nanotrasen command! Ask the Curator to scan this book into the computer, using the Scanner.png Scanner.
- Once scanned, use the Library Computer.png Check In/Out Computer's 5th function, titled, "5. Upload New Title to Archive".
- Here you can change the category, change the author once more, and view the title.
- After reviewing the book, and being ready to publish, use the "UPLOAD" command.

# How To Add A Painting To The Database

Do you have an artistic soul? Did you look at the dozens of scrawled penises on the gallery wall and think: "Hey, I could do better than that"? Your prayers have been answered! Here is everything you need to know to ensure that your pixel art will be preserved in the /tg/station database until the sun explodes.

- Get a canvas. Some spawn in the library, but they can also be crafted from cloth.
- Get some crayons or a spraycan. Remember that with a spraycan, you can paint with all the colors of the RGB spectrum; a must have for any serious artist.
- While holding your tool of choice, left-click on the canvas to begin painting your masterpiece.
- Click "Finish" to finalize your painting, and give it a creative, thought-provoking title. You can also sign it, if you're a clout-chasing poser.
- Pick the "Collection" in which you want your painting to belong: Public, Secure, or Private. Note that not every station will have all three options. The collection you choose will affect where your painting will spawn. Public frames are usually the most numerous. Secure frames are usually behind glass. Private frames are located in the curator's office, or in a discreet location.
- Place the painting into one of the roundstart frames. If all the roundstart frames are occupied, you can remove a painting using wirecutters. Crafting your own painting frame and putting it on a wall won't save your painting.
- Ensure that your painting doesn't get removed from its frame before the shift ends.
- Voila! If your painting is in its frame at the end of the shift, it will be permanently saved to the database, and will have a chance of appearing the gallery in future rounds!

# Adventuring

Do you think giving out books is boring? Does literally no one go to the library except for if they are seeking safety or committing a crime? Here you will learn about how to do fun shit and because no one cares about the library. (For more non-librarian librarian work check out the tips section)

## The Heroic Beacon

Your loadout. This will decide your adventuring destiny:

"First Man on the Moon - 1960's": A set containing an ancient NASA Voidsuit. Guaranteed* to not leak! Each set has:
- A Full NASA Voidsuit. A Stylish red without the hassle of more than two pieces.
- A GPS. For the space explorer who loses their way home.
- An Oxygen Tank.

"Braveheart, the Scottish rebel - 1300's": A kit containing a patriotic Scottish Outfit. Wearing it fills you with a hatred of the English. This box contains:
- An unarmored Kilt with matching sandals.
- A Claymore with average damage and a chance to block incoming attacks.
- A can of ~~War~~ Spray paint.

"Courageous Tomb Raider - 1940's": A set containing the gear of the infamous Indiana Jones. Perfect for the curator with a prize on his mind. Every set contains:
- A Full Treasure Hunter's garb. A Stylish hat, a treasure hunter's armored Coat, a Classy Suit, and a pair of mining boots designed for the rough outdoors.
- A Whip with average damage and a high chance to disarm opponents.
w
"Carp Hunter, Wildlife Expert - 2506": A kit containing everything you need to become a World-Renowned* Carp Hunter! Each kit has:
- A battered Carp Space suit. Still space worthy, but if you want protection, you'd be better off wearing nothing.
- A Carp Face Mask. Pairs well with the suit.
- A hunting knife with minor damage and a bonus to Butchering.
- And a sack of meat, to feed your fishy friends.

"Mothic Flight Pioneer - 2100's": A kit containing a Mothic Fleet member's standard equipment. Each kit has:
- A Mothic softcap and Flightsuit. The suit even comes with pockets for small snacks!
- A Wrench, Screwdriver, and Crowbar. For every maintenance need.
- A Full stack each of Iron and Glass.
- An old-school Lantern.
"Ethereal Trailwarden - 2450's": A set containing the outfit of a Sprout Trailwarden. Each set has:
- A Trailwarden tunic and Oilcoat.
- A Saddlepack. This bulky bag distributes the weight of what's put inside, letting it carry as much as a Duffle Bag without any of the slowdown.

## Breaking News!

Behind the library desk is a handy newscaster to work with. Since the Curator is given a tape recorder and a camera with spare film, this allows you to keep the crew informed of station events, such as memorable performances by the clown, interviews with prominent people, murders or even writing smutty tabloid articles. Photos from your camera can be attached to the news articles you post. Alternatively, you could use your photocopier to copy your ass and attach the results to your news articles.

The newscaster can also print out up to 15 newspapers, and can be refilled by adding more paper. After that, you'll want to deliver the newspaper to frequently visited areas like the Medbay, Brig, and more.

# Languages

As an academic, you studied even the most obscure languages known in the universe. You can innately understand secret cultspeak, robotic beeping, drone chatter, and can even interpret xenomorph hissing. What is seriously puzzling is that you can also speak those languages, which supports the theory that Curators are just failed wizards. 

# DJ Operations!

The station's Curator can also double up as a radio host! It's a new thing that we do here because it's fun and interactive! So, let's cover some things regarding the DJ Booth.

- Cassette tapes: These tapes are the means to play music! We'll cover more in depth later.
- Walkmans: A portable means to enjoy taped music. Fits in your pocket for ease of use.
- Space Board of Music Postbox: This is how you get tapes approved (admin review).
- Advanced Cassette Deck: The recording and splicing machine that is the heart of the system. We'll cover this later.
- Radio Microphone: Speak in the vicinity of this machine and it will broadcast to the station's special Radio channel!
- Cassette Player: The machine that you use in order to play music to the whole station at once... well, everyone with a radio headset on!

## Building Tapes

This is the section most people will be interested in: how do I make a tape and send it off to get approved. So, here we go.

- When you pick up a tape, you'll wanna grab a pen and name it.
- Place the tape into an Advanced Cassette Deck. There's a public one in the library if you're not the Curator.
- You'll get a window that will let you remove songs, edit the design of the tape and add songs.
- To add a song, get the youtube URL, example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pTnbc-U2YQ. The segment you want is after the = there, in which case the string will then be 0pTnbc-U2YQ. Place that into the TGUI box that appears after clicking ADD SONG and it'll add the track to the tape.
- Each side of a tape can hold up to SEVEN SONGS. Flip the tape and you can add another whole SEVEN SONGS!
- Once you're done, eject and off you go.

After the tape is complete, you will take it and have at least 5000 Monkecoin in your balance to submit the tape for review. Here's a few tips to help give you a better chance of the admins giving the tape a pass.

- Ensure all server rules are followed!
- Keep the tracks under 10 minutes. This helps keep the potential buffers from causing issues with BYOND itself.
- Keep things interesting: not everyone wants to hear ASMR tracks, despite your best intentions.
- If you're REALLY unsure it doesn't hurt to ask ahead of time of a particular tape or not before you send it!

# Tips

Curator system is much more robust than most people think:
- You can activate barcode scanner to switch modes.
- You can use it to add printed books to your library's "inventory", then use the check in/check out computer to actually give people books for specified amount of time, like a real library would.
- You can cut inventory slots in books with wirecutters.
- Your whip will instantly disarm anyone you hit with it.
- Many people don't visit the library because the literature is ~~trash~~ poorly curated. Try setting aside a special shelf with hand-picked books. Decorate, advertise and hold events to attract the attention of passerby!
    You have Construction access so you can make a base and go to lavaland or renovate the Vacant Office. Try it out!
    Pry up wood tiles with a screwdriver or deconstruct tables with a wrench and fix all the rotting wood tiles in your library. Get those cobwebs cleared out, too!
    Your access to the Auxiliary Base Construction Area can provide you with meson scanners and a full toolbelt, along with a cargo headset.
    If you don't want to browse books through the amazing medium of the BYOND engine, you can explore the database they're all stored in. You will need a /tg/ forum account to access it. There's also a database for paintings!
    You are first and last line of defense against low-effort garbage as it attempts to enter the persistent database. Next time you leave your library, remember that. We are all counting on you.
