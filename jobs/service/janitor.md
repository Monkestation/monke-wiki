## It's time to clean!
As a Janitor you should be trying to keep the station sanitary, well lit, and prevent it from being covered in blood and gibs! You have several tools for doing this, such as a mop, a bucket, and soap. Some areas that you may find need your "special attention" are: the Medbay, the Bar, and the Brig. Remember to keep a good grip on your jani-cart, and a pushbroom handy.


### Tools of the trade.
In your time on the station you'll need to use several tools to keep the ~~vandals~~ Clown and Mime from mucking up your precious hallways. Listed below are the tools, and how you should use them.
- Mop: Your weapon against the bloody footprints and pools of liquid that flood the hallways, left click on a janicart or bucket to fill the mop, and right click to wring it out. Left click on a mess with a wet mop to clean it, and right click on a puddle with a dry mop to soak it up. It's main downside is that it leaves the tiles you clean wet, which can cause people to slip. Put down a wet floor sign, so it's not your problem.
- Bucket: The magazine for your mop. Fill it with water from a sink or water tank, and you can use it to wet your mop, or fill a jani-cart.
- Soap: Soap is used to clean messes off of the floor, be it blood or grafitti calling the captain a nerd. 
- Cleaner Grenades: For when a mess is so bad you don't want to deal with it. Simply use the grenade in hand, and throw it at the mess. It will clean a large area with the foam.
- Wet floor signs: Put them down where you mop so that the crew won't come after you.
- Jani-cart: How you transport your tools. It can carry a mop, a pushbroom, a bottle of space cleaner, four wet floor signs, and a trash bag! Drag it around for half the round until someone decides to be funny and steal it.
- Push-broom: How to get your cart back. The pushbroom is a weapon against people and trash alike, wield it and you can push trash along the ground in the direction you walk. It makes an effective weapon against MIMES.
- Space Cleaner: A spray bottle full of cleaning solution. Cleans messes more quickly than the mop or soap, and but unfortunately has limited uses before you need to go to a chemist.
- Trash Bag: A plastic bag to hold the debris and detrius of the station, use it to pick up all the trash on a tile, you can then empty it into a disposals chute.
- Keyring: How you get around. When a Head of Staff notices a mess, they can press a button in their alert console to give you limited access to their department. You will need to search through them before opening the door.

### In practice.
In practice you will want to rely on the mop and soap to clean basic messes such as blood splatters, pools of vomit, green sludge, and gibs. The soap has a limited number of uses, while the mop can be used as long as it has water, and make sure you use wet floor signs. Larger messes should be handled with Space Cleaner and Cleaner Grenades. Pools should be cleaned with the mop. Trash should be swept into a pile and picked up with the trash bag. If your keyring tells you you have access to a department, make sure you head over there as there is probably a large mess.
