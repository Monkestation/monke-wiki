# General Information
## Introduction
Ranching is a unique sub-department of Botany, It focuses on the raising and mutation of chickens. Unlike the similar sub-department Xenobiology, Ranching requires specific circumstances for chickens to raise. See [Chicken Information](https://wiki.monkestation.com/en/jobs/service/Ranching#chicken_info) for specific mutations for each chicken, and see the links on each mutation for the requirements of said mutation.
## Before We Start
There are a few important things we need to know to ensure your raching success. What each chickens favorite food is, this is important for raising a chickens happiness which is a crucial piece in getting them to follow your commands, and for getting specific mutations. The opposite is also true, making them mad will also eventually lower you out of friendship and prevent you from controlling them, and in some cases will allow Hostile Chickens to attack you IE Raptors.

Another important piece of knowledge is which chemicals when infused into feed increase or decrease a chickens happiness, for that information see [Chemical Infusion Interaction](https://wiki.monkestation.com/en/jobs/service/Ranching#chemical_list) for more information.

Finally and probably most important is the effects of unhappiness, aging, and crowding. If there are too many chickens within vision of a chicken they will get cramped and lose happiness every tick, This can very quickly kill chickens as most of them can die if too unhappy. Which brings us to the second part the effects of unhappiness, best case scenario they die. Worst case they turn hostile and start attacking you. Age is a factor seperate from the previous two, and happens naturally most chickens live until the ripe age of 100 which takes around an hour and a half real life time to happen.

## Example
1. Get yourself a chicken scanner, egg bag, and a chicken encyclopedia(unless you want the wiki open to look at mutation requirements).
2. Choose which chickens you want to grow, unless its a long round its better to focus on a select few.
> Remember just because raptor chickens can be tamed does not mean you should rush them every shift, they are a workplace hazard assuming you die as no one else would be able to control them.
{.is-warning}
3. For most chickens you will want to start with maximizing your happiness, and since its roundstart you won't have their favorite foods so your best bet is a large infusion of a happiness chemical, the easist to obtain in bulk would be sugar which can be gotten from the bartender or chemist. Infuse the sugar into a new batch of feed by adding some food(any will do aslong as its not hated) and add the beaker and Alt-Click the Feed Machine, this will eject an empty beaker, and a new feed that would be something like: wheat Chicken Feed Infused with Sugar. Now place this in the pen with either the white or brown chickens depending on what chicken you want, and wait until they eat.
> If you are going for Void Chickens or Sad Clown Chickens Step 3 is not needed as you want to do the inverse to lower happiness.
{.is-info}
4. After they have eaten a bit climb into the pen, Alt Click the chicken scanner to turn it into stat scanning mode and scan the chicken, you will want to take note of the happiness value aswell as the age. Make sure you also hand pet the chickens or hand feed them, eating feed off the floor does not build your trust with them and may cause issues if your going for hostile chickens.
> If you are coming in late to a shift, they will have been incredibly hungry, and as such will probably be very unhappy so your first few generations of chickens may be sad.
{.is-info}
5. Now that you've confirmed they are happy you can look for what items and foods you will need in this example we are going for a Stone Chicken so we need to first Get a Glass Chicken, This means we need to get a Large Beaker and a Syringe. Before getting that we also should ask our fellow botanists to plant some weed for the stone chicken.
> Remember SS13 isn't a single-player game, don't steal all the thunder. You're gonna have chickens already let the gardeners garden while you go ask for the rest of your stuff.
{.is-info}
6. We are now back with the Beaker and Syringe, we place these on the ground near the nest box of the chicken we are raising (for safety if its not food i'd leave it 2-3 tiles from the nestbox). This part may take a little bit because mutations take atleast 4 eating before it can lay mutations than its a chance based on how many mutations so for white chickens this may take a few attempts especially because some of the mutations are easy to secure like Ixworth.

7. Lets now say we have our glass chicken which is cool in itself but not what we want we now make feed infused with Cannabis and place that down the glass chickens will eat this and again after 4 eatings will have a chance at laying stone eggs, when those hatch we have completed the chicken we want!
> There we go, we now have the chicken we wanted to get, this can be applied to most if not all of the chickens in the game some may take longer than this as this is only a second tier chicken we wanted to get.
