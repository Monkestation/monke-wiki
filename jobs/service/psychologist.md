# Psychologist

| \[ job_image ]<br>Psychologist | Access: Medbay, Psychology Office<br>Additional Access: Coroner Office<br>Difficulty: Easy<br>Supervisors: Head of Personnel, Chief Medical Officer<br>Duties: Advocate sanity, self-esteem, and teamwork in a station staffed with headcases.<br>Guides: N/A<br>Alternate Titles: Therapist, Psychiatrist, Counsellor|

The Psychologist is a listening ear, a shoulder to cry on, and a friend to all. Nominally part of service, and physically part of medbay, they are tasked with diffusing disputes and seeing to the psychological well-being of all the crew.

Bare minimum requirements: Talk to any crew seeking your counsel. 

# Duties

Nanotrasen cares deeply about the mental health of its employees, and to this end, they have seen fit to drag an old carpet and couch into a disused broom closet in medbay, even going so far as to hang up a motivational poster. Thus, the Psychology Office was born and qualified individuals sought out to work there.

Your job is primarily to simply talk and listen to any and all who request it, and secondarily to write, sign, and dispense prescriptions (redeemable with the CMO, chemists, doctors, or perhaps even botanists and bartender) and doctor's notes for patients as you see fit. 

# CBT: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

You begin the round in your office with a black suit or suit skirt, laceup shoes, a clipboard, a medical PDA, a headset with both medical and service frequencies, a small selection of pills, and a burning desire to help others. Also in your office; a medical records laptop, carbon paper and a filing cabinet, a couch and chair for therapy sessions, an adorable moth plushie to comfort those who are reliving traumatic events or for "So talk to the plushie as if it was your boss... what do you want to say to them?" exercises, and a straight jacket, muzzle, earmuffs, and blindfold.

You are, make no mistake, essentially useless to the functioning of the station, but don't let that stop you from trying! Here are some ideas on how to best serve the crew:

- Defer to the HoP, CMO, other heads of staff, and security to help diffuse disputes and talk disagreements into soft landings
- Help integrate criminals back into working society.
- Talk to and provide company to sad, angry, confused, traumatized, or bored crew members.
- Collaborate with the lawyers on perceived injustices and abuses and serve as an expert witness in court.
- Keep the rarely utilized medical records up to date.
- Conduct totally ethical experiments on how the crew responds to stress and confusion.
- Bar RP until you die from an overdose of alcohol
- Get surgery access and perform lobotomies on volounteers.
- Slow down supermatter delaminations.
- Die in a funny way by attempting to negotiate with antagonists
- Conduct psychological research by following the clown around and recording everything he does on a piece of paper
- Do "social experiments"
