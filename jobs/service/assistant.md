Assistants are the most versatile and expendable workers on the station. They are recommended to new-comers who have read or are reading the [tutorial](/guides/tutorial) and are still getting their space legs.

Assistants begin their shifts around the station but usually congregate in Primary Tool Storage, where they can acquire some basic tools such as screwdrivers and wrenches. If you are charismatic or lucky, the Head of Personnel can add more access to your Identification Card. With more access and perhaps a custom job title, perhaps you can find a purpose on the station at last.

Sometimes you are a God among men and sometimes you are dead within twelve seconds of round start. It all depends on how you set up and the luck of the station.

**Bare minimum requirements**: Don't be a total shitler.

# Actually Assisting People

If you are an assistant and wish to actually assist people, you can try asking over the radio if anyone needs help with anything. This may or may not work. You can also approach people in person, which has a higher chance of success. Live out your dreams of being a 22-year-old coffee bitch intern IN SPACE!

Particularly helpful assistants may want to have a more permanent job on the station. The HoP can promote you to a position if you ask nicely and convince them that you're not a traitor (this is particularly useful if you are, in fact, a traitor). It helps if that job is urgent, like doctors when the crew is dying or engineers when the station is a hole in space. However, the HoP does not have to, and you will just have to live with that. Unless, of course, you're the traitor.

Assistants usually get into non-lethal fights often due to accidently or intentionally causing trouble and are seen the most in places called "rage-cages". Therefore, assistants sparring with each-other and other crew members in both rage-cages and outside of them usually trains up very Robust individuals. If you're looking to become robust, this is the role for you. 

# Duties? What Duties?

Assistants are usually the most aware civilians on the station due to the fact they're constantly on the move. You'll find that that assistants make great informants! 

## Gimmicks

Due to the lack of responsibility, you'll usually find that assistants are the ones responsible for renovating the bar with a dance floor or boxing ring, converting the dorms into interrogation rooms, and all other sorts of wacky projects. An assistant is also a good job for playing a single-round gimmick.

# Into the ghetto

As an assistant you may not be given the same gear or access others have, even if you ask nicely. Therefore, you'll sometimes may have to rely on yourself and scavenge. But when you don't have much to work with, it's always nice to do things ghetto. 

## Ghetto Defense

As an assistant, Security may treat every word you tell them as a lie, here's how you can and what you need to protect yourself when they're incompetent and it's been announced that there's a rampaging antagonist on the station. 

> Remember, you are still subject to rules 2 and 9, escalations and self antagging. Don't self antag, escalate things appropriately, and most things you think you can do might actually be fine.
{.is-warning}

- The firesuit and emergency firesuit can make for some pretty decent armor at the cost of making you slow. The emergency firefighting helmet also has a togglable light.
- You can make makeshift handcuffs with cable coils.
- There are many more things you can do, but some things are best found out on your own. Try to experiment as much as you can and see what works best for you.

## Ghetto Healing

As an assistant, medbay may not want to patch you up for many reasons, ranging from the doctors being busy healing more important people to you having deep-fried the CMO's beloved metal stick at the beginning of the round. However, there are some ways to get yourself back in shape without resorting to medkit theft.

- Having the "Drunken Resilience" and "Light Drinker" quirks will allow you to heal faster depending on how drunk you are. Since being a light drinker makes you get drunk more easily, use this to your advantage, find exactly of how much you can take without passing out and dying then chug to the limit of how much booze you can take.
- Bungo Juice and Banana Juice can allow monkeys to heal at a decent rate. If you're a monkey, get this whenever you can.
- Chugging Lime Juice, Tea and iced tea all together can make for a semi-decent toxin heal. But spinning until you vomit heals toxin damage too, so if you really don't have access to the bar and you have toxin damage, spin until you vomit several times somewhere safe.
- Having a buddy in the tide do ghetto surgery and ghetto revival with a Stunprod in a secluded Maintenance room can prove useful if the Chief Medical Officer and his entire team won't serve you.
- It also helps to have your personal plant trays, a steady supply of fertilizer and water along with some reliable seeds from the Botanist.
- Sleep heals you!
- If you can access a protolathe (for materials) or find an oil pool on the floor, you can easily make large quantities of Miner's Salve, a chemical that can slowly heal brute and burn damage with no downsides.
