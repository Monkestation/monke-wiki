# Prisoners

- Flavor Text: "I can't believe we managed to break out of a Nanotrasen superjail! Sadly though, our work is not done. The emergency teleport at the station logs everyone who uses it, and where they went. It won't be long until Centcom tracks where we've gone off to. I need to work with my fellow escapees to prepare for the troops Nanotrasen is sending, I'm not going back."

As a prisoner, you spawn with shivs and a determined moodlet (the same moodlet that traditional antagonists get), which essentially keeps you always in a good mood. You also get a bit more leeway with escalation and general antagonist behavior, as you are an enemy of Nanotrasen.
# Cultists

- Flavor Text: "Blessed be our journey so far, but I fear the worst has come to our doorstep, and only those with the strongest faith will survive. Our religion has been repeatedly culled by Nanotrasen because it is categorized as an "Enemy of the Corporation", whatever that means. Now there are only four of us left, and Nanotrasen is coming. When will our god show itself to save us from this hellish station?!"

Worshippers of the forbidden and forgotten deity "Yalp Elor," 4 cultists spawn in maintenance. They are unarmed, but they are dressed in holiday garments, and have an intimidating tiki mask.
# The Invisible Man

- Flavour Text: Looks like my most recent dose of invisibility juice just ran out. Great. Formerly a project lead for an experimental cloaking technology lab, now on the run and accused of stealing workplace secrets. No idea what they're talking about though. I didn't steal any secrets, I just borrowed some of the prototypes my team and I had worked on. I worked on them, I MADE them. Now they want MY toys back? Not until I'm done playing with them...

A single fugitive that spawns with a toggleable cloaking implant (Makes you slightly more cloaked than a Ninja) and several stabilized Saturn X injectors (Which turn you fully invisible so long as you're not wearing anything for ten minutes each)
# Waldo

- Flavor Text: "Hi, Friends! My name is Waldo. I'm just setting off on a galaxywide hike. You can come too. All you have to do is find me. By the way, I'm not traveling on my own. wherever I go, there are lots of other characters for you to spot. First find the people trying to capture me! They're somewhere around the station!"

A single fugitive, spawns with a conspicuous striped outfit that can't be removed and the knock spell.
