Revenants are ghosts that have been infused with strange alien energies and brought partially back into the mortal plane in areas filled with death. They are invisible to the naked eye but can still be influenced by magical or holy means. In addition, machinery may recognize a revenant's presence. Revenants are typically immortal while invisible, but most of their spooky abilities will reveal them to the crew for brief amounts of time. 

# Becoming a Revenant

There are two ways to become a revenant. The first is for an admin to spawn in a revenant and quickly place you into the mob. The second way is for a random event to happen. You must have the Revenant preference toggled on (use the verb for special candidacy in the Preferences tab) and you may be selected. A sound will play to your client in case you were alt-tabbed or something and you will spawn in certain areas that are thick with death or the presence of the dead. 

# Delicious Life Force

So, you're a newly-spawned Revenant. How spooky! One of the first things you may notice is that you look badass you have a large display to the right with a number and an E next to it. That's Essence, and it is your most important resource.

Your maximum health is your Essence, and it will regenerate up to 75 by default. If your Essence hits zero, you die, leaving a pile of blue dust that you will revive from within a minute if not scattered.

Most of your spooky abilities are behind a point lock and you need to have some extra Essence to unlock them. To get Essence, you have one ability by default: Harvest. This can be used while clicking on an adjacent dead human to gain a small amount of Essence. This is a very small amount, though if the target is alive and unconscious it can be much higher, and even greater if the target is still alive and awake! You can't drain the same corpse twice, however, so you'll need to get creative with your powers or wander around for a bit.

You can only acquire new abilities with the Essence that you have harvested from living and dead creatures. This means that if you wanted to get an ability that costs 75 Essence, you would need to have a total of 150 Essence on hand to acquire it.

Note that while you're harvesting something or have recently used an ability, you can be seen and attacked by the living, and will be unable to move while channeling the ability. Once you can move again, you will still be revealed for a short period of time with a series of weaknesses. This is your most vulnerable form, and you can be killed if not careful! While in this state, you cannot move through walls or most solid objects and are slow, though you can open doors, move across tables and plastic flaps, as well as go through living mobs.

As a Revenant, you have access to ghost chat. You may ask them for advice or help, but don't be too trusting of them. Whilst they can help locate bodies for you, they might also try to make you believe that you're immune to being dusted by the Supermatter (you aren't!).
## Abilities

Below is a list of all the abilities a Revenant can use and unlock.

# Fighting the Unholy Menace

So you're a crew member and you just saw a guy with purple lights flowing out of him leading into a spooky blue ghost. You've shouted over the radio and now the rest of the crew knows. Revenants can range from annoying to amazingly dangerous, and the more corpses they drain, the more powerful they get. However, there are a few things you can do to fight revenants.

First of all, get the chaplain. Their null rod is incredibly powerful against the Revenant and will drain large chunks of essence from them. Revenants are generally hard to fight, mainly because they're both invisible, can phase through walls, and can't take damage in this state, but there are a few ways around it. Generally, waiting for them to drain someone or reveal themselves is the best time to go ham on their ass.

They also can't pass through tiles with holy water or salt piles unless they Defile it, so go coat the station's floors in it, or better yet, spray it over them when they cast something. Salt also temporaily stuns and reveals them

When you temporarily kill a revenant it will drop glimmering residue on the ground. If this is left untouched the revenant will respawn after 60 seconds. 

**To permanently kill the revenant, pick up the glimmering residue it leaves behind when killed, and throw it. **
