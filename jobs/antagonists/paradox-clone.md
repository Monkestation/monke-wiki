Bluespace technology has destabilized the very fabric of reality, even time itself!

Sometimes during a shift, it's possible for a PARADOX CLONE of one of the station's crew to manifest somewhere on the station. There is no telling the two apart, as the clone is merely them from another reality. To maintain timeline coherency, the paradox clone must now hunt down and kill the original and take their place or die trying. 

# The Imposter Among Us

Paradox Clones are spawned during the round and chosen from available ghosts who sign up for it. A random station crewmember will be selected to be cloned, and the Paradox Clone will spawn with that exact appearance.

The paradox clone is extremely simple as far as antagonists go. No tricky gadgets, no fancy powers, no outside support, nothing. The only advantage they have is the fact that they have the exact appearance, quirks, and DNA as a random crew member on the station, wearing the same clothes they were at the start of the shift, including their ID. This CAN include jobs normally excluded from being an antagonist like security officers or the detective. The only extra thing the paradox clone spawns with is a mechanical toolbox that helps them from being stuck in maints if their ID doesn't have maints access.

The sole objective for a clone is to assassinate the original, and to act as them for the rest of the round (ideally without being detected).

That's it really. 

# Tips

- Try to avoid being noticed by the original too early.
- Copy your target's speech patterns to more effectively imitate them.
- Try to ambush your target in an out of the way area, where nobody will notice if you replace them.
- Alternatively, attack them in an extremely obvious manner, claiming that they're the clone.
- Makeshift weapons are your friend here. You can often scrounge up the parts without even leaving maintenance.
- Most tips that apply to changelings also apply to you.
- If your target is a paramedic or proactive doctor, try attaching a jumpsuit with sensors enabled to a mutilated monkey or monkey human to lure them to you.
- If your target is hard to reach and security is particularly bloodthirsty today, try framing them for a capital crime- then relax and sit back as security does all the hard work for you.
- Keep track of any changes in your target's appearance. Your greatest strength is that you're indistinguishable from your target, but you lose that if their outfit is very clearly different from yours.
- If you can get access to genetics, consider creating a swarm of monkey-human clones and blending in among them. This won't kill your target but it'll be very funny and very hard to pick out the real you.
- If the quiet approach fails, there's always plan B. Security can't identify giblets!
