# Blob

Blob is a random event where a large blob infests the station and starts destroying everything its path, including walls, fixtures and creatures. The crew must destroy the blob to prevent it from destroying a pre-determined amount of the station, currently 400 tiles. Once the blob reaches critical mass, the blob has a minute or so to absolutely devour the station with its now insane spread rate and infinite resources. Only thing to do as crew at that point is to launch yourself to lavaland in an escape pod. 

# OH SHIT I'M A BLOB WHAT DO I DO

So you're a blob. Open the status tab. You have a minimum time of one minute before you can spawn, and a maximum time of 6 minutes until you will forcefully be spawned on your current location. You can move around freely and invisibly until you spawn. Try to find a secluded spot with no cameras. Also remember, nearby walls will automatically be destroyed the first few minutes from blob tiles created by your core. Talking normally will send a message to your blob hivemind channel. Your presence will be announced to the crew once you either reach a 75 tile size threshold or 10 minutes have passed since you spawned. 

## Positioning

Positioning is extremely key to winning as a Blob. Improper positioning can result in you being barraged by emitters or quickly found and killed. Main hallways and maint areas too close to main hallways tend to be bad choices to burst in.

You should go position yourself near the place you want your core. You have exact timers of how long you have until you can manually place your core and until the core will be automatically placed for you.

You cannot move onto space or shuttles until your core is placed.

The best place for your core is in an inaccessible area, decreasing the chance of being spotted and being contained. Think along the lines of good Xeno hiding spots. Public hallways are bad. Out-of-the-way places that require elevated access are good. Chokepoints are good. It can also be strategic to spawn in places that will cripple the crew once you destroy them, like telecomms or science or AI sat.

You cannot place your core on top of dense walls or objects, and if there is anyone nearby you will also be unable to place your core.

Try not to place your core where it can be trivially shot from space. You can't easily get to people who are in space and MDDsuits or EVA suits are easy to come by. Remember that lasers go through glass. Then remember that x-ray lasers go through walls. 

## Blob Chemicals

Blobs are made of chemicals. These affect the color of the blob tiles, blobbernauts and blob spores, as well as the effects of their their attacks (which count as vapor). You start with a free chemical reroll, and get another after a few minutes of cooldown. Every time you reroll you get to choose between 5 randomly selected chemicals. These are the available chemicals you can get: 

| Name | Color  | Attack Effects (Blobbernauts deal 80%) | Positive Effects | Negative Effects |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Blazing Oil |        | 5 Brute Damage, 20 Burn Damage, Lights targets on Fire and makes them scream | When hit with Burn Damage emits a Burst of Flame, Immune to Fire | Weak to Water |
|   Cryogenic Poison    |        | 10 Brute Damage, Injects 7.5u frost oil, 7.5u ice, and also 7.5u of its own poison that deals 0.5 toxin, burn, and brute damage about every 2 seconds.  | N/A | N/A |
|    Debris Devourer    |        | 5 Brute Damage? |  <br>Absorbs items on tiles it moves onto.<br> <br>When attacking, has a chance to throw items at the target.<br> <br>Blobbernauts also have this ability.<br> <br>Spores explode with 3 random objects from the blob on death.<br> <br>Depending on a ratio of items collected to the size of the blob,  grants a damage resistance which grows larger with more items, capped at  10.  | N/A |
|  Electromagnetic Web  |        | 5 Brute Damage, 25 Burn Damage, 20% chance to EMP Targets | Causes EMP if killed by melee, bullets or lasers | Takes 25% More Burn Damage and Full Brute Damage |
|    Energized Jelly    |        | 5 Brute Damage, 15 Oxygen Damage, 30 Stamina Damage. Prevents Breathing for a few seconds. | Immune to Tesla | Takes Burn Damage from EMPs |
|   Explosive Lattice   |        | 20 Brute Damage to Target, 10 Brute Damage to Nearby Mobs | Spores and zombies explode on death. Immune to Explosions. | Takes 50% More Damage from Fires and Tesla |
|   Networked Fibers    |        | 20 Brute Damage, 15 Burn Damage |   Can only expand manually (by clicking). Can only expand next to core or nodes. Manual expansion near your Core/node moves the core/code  to that tile. Core regenerates health 2.5 times faster than other  chemical types. Nodes and core produce extra resources instead of  producing Blob Tiles. Remember you can alt+click on a blob tile to  remove it, in case you get stuck.   | N/A |
|   Pressurized Slime   |        | 15 Brute Damage, 10 Oxygen Damage, 25 Stamina Damage | Releases water when hit or killed. Has 50% brute resistance. | N/A |
|    Reactive Spines    |        | 5 Brute Damage, 25 Armor and Bio Resist-Ignoring Brute Damage | Attacks nearby area when hit with melee attacks | N/A |
| Regenerative Materia  |        | 5 Brute Damage, 17.5 Toxin Damage, Targets Appear Full Health, Injects Toxin | Core regenerates health 10 times faster than normal and also generates 1 extra resource. | N/A |
|   Replicating Foam    |        | 22.5 Brute Damage | Expands when burned but is not immune to fire, Chance of Bonus Expansion | Takes Double Brute Damage |
|  Shifting Fragments   |        | 22.5 Brute Damage | When damaged always swaps positions with a nearby blob | N/A                                                                              |
|   Synchronous Mesh    |        | 17.5 to 70 Brute Damage Based on Nearby Blobs | Spreads Damage Between Nearby Blobs | Takes 25% More Damage from Fire, Explosions, and Tesla;  Damage spreading means that each killed blob tile will also end up with  the tiles around it killed  |
|  Distributed Neurons  |        |                  5 Brute Damage, 15 Toxin Damage, Gains Zombie From unconscious humans at a 5 resource cost, Ghost controllable spores | Sometimes produces Fragile Spores when killed. Ghosts can control  factory-spawned spores. The spores will harvest sleeping/crit targets  for 5-10 additional resources and a blob zombie. All strains can make blob zombies, but this one doesn't require them to be dead. (Used to be  named Zombifying Pods) | N/A |

# Surviving the first few minutes

You build structures by hovering over a blob tile and clicking the HUD icon for that structure. You will get a fail message if that spot is not valid. There should be ONE thing on your mind, that being placing a Resource Blob close to your Core as soon as possible.

Then, create a Node Blob a short distance from your core and create another Resource Blob next to it. After you have two Resource Blobs, produce a Factory Blob, again preferably as close to your core as possible. Once that is done, you should be able to defend against the crew reasonably well. Just keep producing nodes with resource blobs near them and you'll do fine. 

# Blob Powers

Blobs attack and destroy the station by trying to place Normal Blobs on tiles, which destroys items and structures on the target tile, and applies chemical effects to humans and heavily damages other mobs, such as cyborgs. You can expand/attack manually by left-clicking the target or target tile, but this costs chemicals. Hemming in targets by placing Normal Blobs behind them before attacking is extremely effective.

You, the Overmind, can also place special blob pieces or activate special functions and abilities. You must have enough Power to place those structures or activate those abilities, however. 

| Appearance  |       Name       | Production Cost  | Other Requirements | Description |

|      #      | Blob Core        | N/A              | N/A                                                                      | The core of a blob. Protect these at all costs. Pulses nearby  Resource Blobs and Factory Blobs, activating their effects. As an  Overmind, you can see the health of your core from the HUD; if it  lowers, go there to defend it immediately.                                                                                                       |
|      #      | Normal Blob      | 4 Resources      | Must be cardinally adjacent to another Blob of any type to place a blob  | A normal blob. Attempting to place one on a tile containing a dense  object, or diagonally from another blob, will cause you to attack that  tile, damaging mobs and structures. Attempting to expand into space is  much less effective, having a high chance of failure. HOTKEY for placement is Left-Click. |
|      #      | Strong Blob      | 15 Resources     | Can only be placed on Normal Blob.                                       | Consumes a Normal Blob to place a strong and hard to kill blob that  prevents atmospheric threats from passing and is immune to fire. HOTKEY for placement is Ctrl-Click. |
|      #      | Reflective Blob  | 15 Resources     | Can only be placed on Strong Blob.                                       | Upgrades a Strong Blob into a Reflective Blob. Will reflect  projectiles based on their ricochet chances. Shots from emitters or  lasers will be typically bounced off. HOTKEY for placement is Ctrl-Click. |
|      #      | Resource Blob    | 40 Resources     | Must be at least 4 tiles away from another Resource Blob                 | Consumes a Normal Blob to place a special blob that, when pulsed by a  Node Blob or the Blob Core, gives additional Resources to the Overmind  that placed it. Additional Resource Blobs slow resource generation down  slightly. |
|      #      | Node Blob        | 50 Resources     | Must be at least 5 tiles away from another Node Blob                     | Consumes a Normal Blob to place a blob, much like the core, that  will slowly expand, heal other blobs, and activate the effects of blob  factories and resource nodes. |
|      #      | Factory Blob     | 60 Resources     | Must be at least 7 tiles away from another Factory Blob                  | Consumes a Normal Blob to place a special blob that, when pulsed by a  Node Blob or the Blob Core, will spawn a Blob Spore, up to a maximum of  three. |
|      #      | Blob Spore       | N/A              | Produced from Factory Blobs                                              | A fragile spore that does low damage and explodes into a cloud of  gas when killed. The gas contains the chemical of the Overmind that  placed the factory that spawned the spore. AI controlled and can be  commanded with middle-click. Can be controlled by ghosts if the blob strain is 'Distributed Neurons'. |
|      #      | Blob Zombie      | N/A              | A Blob Spore and a corpse                                                | A Blob Spore that has taken over a corpse, a Blob Zombie is harder  to kill, gains health from the corpse's armor, does more damage, and  will still explode into a cloud of gas when killed. AI controlled and  can be commanded with middle-click, but ghosts can choose to play them as well. |
|      #      | Blobbernaut      | 40 Resources     | An undamaged Factory Blob                                                | Heavily damages a Factory Blob to create a player-controlled Blobbernaut  which does high damage while being extremely hard to kill. However,  unlike a blob spore, it does not explode into a cloud of gas when  killed, instead applying the blob's chemical when attacking targets. The  blobbernaut will slowly die if its factory is destroyed.  |

# How to play as a Blobbernaut

If you spawn as a Blobbernaut it's your job to obey the Blob Overmind, and help it survive and expand. You start with 50% health, so heal up first thing you do. You can communicate with the blob hivemind channel by using :b by talking normally. You do not understand common speech.

As a Blobbernaut, you have a lot of health (around 400). Managing your health is a key to success. Pay attention to your health at all times. You can regenerate fast by staying near a yellow node or the blob core. You will run faster on blob tiles. You slowly take damage when not on a blob tile. If your factory is destroyed, you will take damage until you die. You can not claim a new factory.

A good tactic is to do hit-and-run attacks, and then constantly run back to safety to heal up. Against soft, living targets you can often get many strikes in before you need to retreat, or even kill them completely. Mechs though, such as Durands, can kill you quickly with a couple of punches, so play it extra safe versus mechs.

Another important use for your health is to tank shots for your Overmind's core and structures. If the core is destroyed, you lose. You can body block a surprising amount of damage, even from beam rifles, before you need to retreat to heal up. If the enemy uses laser weapons, you can use this to your advantage to see when and where you need to block a shot.

Remember, sometimes you don't need to kill your enemies. As long as you prevent the crew from destroying nodes and other structures, your Overmind may eventually reach critical mass and win. 

# KILL DAT FUKKEN BLOB

**The Emergency Shuttle will not depart while a blob core is still alive**, nor will the blob spare you or your precious station from a horrible death. Destroy it before it destroys you.

## Tools of the Trade

Most of your weapons are useless against blobs. The blob doesn't give a fuck about brute damage, nor is it able to be stunned. Generally speaking, what you will want is to do burn damage. (NOTE: This does NOT mean setting fire to everything!) Here are some tools at your disposal:

- Armor: The blob, in addition to expanding, can attack. Blobs do a variety of damage, but are blocked by armor and bio protection, so riot armor or bio-suits, are helpful. Don't let yourself get surrounded!

- Welding tools: Cheap, readily available from YouTool machines (hack them for two more Upgraded Welding Tools) or the autolathe. Grab one and start burning away. Make a path towards a resource node and take it out. One guy with a welder isn't going to be able to breach the core, so don't try. It's a good idea to grab some Fuel Tanks to keep nearby so you can refuel quickly, but make sure your welder is OFF before refueling, and be sure the blob doesn't get close enough to absorb them. If science division is any good, they'll be passing out plasma cutters before long. They do the same damage as lit welders without any need to refuel, and have the added bonus of not setting plasma on fire in the case that the blob or some chucklefuck pops open a plasma canister. Replace your welder with a cutter ASAP if science starts making them.

- Laser weaponry: HOLD UP THERE HOT SHOT THESE ARE IN LIMITED SUPPLY. Don't take more than two and don't take them if you don't have good armor or a space suit. Carrying the whole armory into maint just lets the blob kill you and bury them. Available in the Armory, in certain heads of staff's quarters and through R&D or Cargo. For the love of god consolidate gear. It's common courtesy to bring along an unwrenched recharger when you use laser weapons.

- Emitters: Set them up as far away from the blob as you can while still striking the core. If the blob reaches them, they're gone. Three emitters side by side matched against the core is a one sided match.

- IEDs: The modest explosion is enough to rip a bit of the blob apart without destroying the floor and ruining atmos for people. Throw them in when you see weakness in the blob's defenses to tear open an attack point.

Once again: DO NOT USE FLAMETHROWERS OR PLASMA FIRES (see below). They are useless and will only make the rest of the crew die and hate you. 

## Stupid Measures

(Do not use these else you might be banned. THESE WILL USUALLY HELP THE BLOB WIN. When in doubt, adminhelp to see whether the Cuban Pete inferno you are about to unleash is kosher.)

- **Large Plasma Fires**: Large fires will eat away at a blob but will also make the area uninhabitable for people without fire suits. It will also not destroy blobs protected by unweakened shield blobs, so you'll need men with fire suits and laser guns to finish the job. If atmos isn't ruined yet this will make the crew hate you.

- **Bombs**: Bombs can destroy any piece of the blob except for the core proper, assuming you can actually hit the thing. Much more likely is that you do superficial damage to an area of the blob, kill half of the people fighting the blob, and then it wins through mass. Just don't do this unless you're THAT confident or you have a truly comical amount of bombs in position and no other options.

## Defcon 1

You've failed to contain the outbreak within the allotted timespan. It's over. In about a minute, the nuke is going to go off. If you're lucky, you might be able to get onto an evac pod or shuttle and get to lavaland before the nuke goes off. If that's not a choice, you can always fling yourself into space and pray. So long as you aren't on the station's level when the nuke goes off, you'll live! 

## Oh Shit, Zombies!

Zombies are hardy bastards that will take people down faster than a school of space carp. Prevention is the best measure, if anyone goes down, pull him out and away from the blob before he either dies or the blob blocks him off. If a zombie's smacking at you, **the natural reaction might be to try running away but don't do that**, running around in a panic is the last thing you should do. Zombies, like many NPC mobs, have laser-guided autoattacks and will relentlessly pursue and hit you until you're down, plus anyone trying to help you won't be able to get a single hit off the zombie if it's running around chasing you.

If you've got a welder in hand (Which you should if there's a blob.) and the zombie isn't armored, simply stand your ground and attack like mad with your lit welder. Even if you're unarmored, it will go down first unless you let it get a few free hits off before fighting back. If it's armored, though, you're fucked unless you have armor, a fire axe, or a buddy or two fighting alongside you.

## Non-Action Crewmates

If you do not have access to the above weaponry, you should stay off the front lines unless you want to get killed and get in everyone's way. However! There are still things you can (and should) do!

### Medbay

Blob mode is one of the few threats where Medbay is actually worth a damn. Here is what to do:

[Medical Doctor](/jobs/medical/medical-doctor): You are field medics. Put your HUD glasses on, grab a first-aid kit and heal people so they don't die. The worst thing is someone with half the armory in their backpack dying and getting engulfed and/or zombified by the blob. Don't let this happen. You will want to bring brute patches/sutures and probably burn patches/meshes if people are inevitably getting caught in lasers or getting hurt by inevitable plasma fire. Don't waste them on someone with 10 damage to one limb; use triage like a real doctor. You can also drag people to cryo and dead people to medbay, but generally you'll be more useful on the field. If you do because no one else is, check their bag so you don't end up removing half the guns and space suits from the field like so much kebab.

[Chemist](/jobs/medical/chemist): Mass produce medicine. During Blob, if the crew is competent, you will run out of medikits very quickly, and Cargo is better off ordering other things. What you'll need depends largely on what kind of blob you're dealing with (brute damage? tox?) and how competent the crew is (FRIENDLY FIRE OH GOD). You can either leave your pills/patches on the counter for people to grab or take them to the battlezone yourself depending on what people are doing.

[CMO](/jobs/medical/chief-medical-officer): You are NOT a field medic, let your slaves do that. Basically, your job is what the CMO's job should be but never is: coordinate doctors, be a head of staff, make sure Medbay proper is doing its job. Contribute your first-aid kit to the cause, and consider contributing your hypospray to someone you trust who can actually use it.

[Virologist](/jobs/medical/virologist): Make healing viruses. 

### Cargo

Order emitters. Order fucking emitters. Don't assume the ones in Engineering Secure Storage will last, or even that anyone will remember to use them at all. Point seven emitters at a blob and it'll regret everything.

Order guns. There is no sense in ordering energy guns, since disabler bolts are useless against blobs. Order the laser gun crates.

Order some goddamn metal and glass. Don't rely on mining to get back at all or on time. If they actually have, though, you can sell excessive amounts of rare resources to buy comical amounts of weapons.

SHIT TYRONE HACK THE FUCKING AUTOLATHES. You can make dozens of INDUSTRIAL WELDERS from a single sheet each of metal and glass. They're 70 metal, 60 glass, or something like that, with a single sheet of material providing 3750 of each. An Industrial Welder is the exact same size as a normal welder but holds 40 fuel They're so cheap to make that they're virtually disposable. In fact, R&D should bump up their materials research with the gold from the vault to make super matter bins, pico-manipulators, etc., so that you can lathe thing stupidly fast at the forward autolathe you fuckers better have made.

No seriously make a fucking extra autolathe near, but not up in the face of, the blob. You can't have too many welders. Seriously. Go forth and print

Use that goddamn lavaland loot to kill dat fukken blob miners. 

### Science

RnD: Trying to "BoH-bomb" the blob by putting a bag of holding into another bag of holding near it is usually not recommended. Instead of falling into the tear of reality, the blob core will teleport to a random location on the station, which might be usefull if you can find the blob quickly, as it will have to remake its defenses. If you are intent on boh bombing the blob though, try to NOT CATCH THE CORE IN THE TEAR. if you do so, you make area that blob cant spread over, but people can shoot over. Also rush the fucking advanced beam weapons. Beam snipers are a reliable way to beat the blob if its medium to large size.

Ordnance: Don't make bombs, because the blob is highly resistant to bombs, being rather solid, and the crew is very much not resistant to bombs. Your experiments, however, can save Science valuable research points.

[Roboticist](/jobs/science/roboticist): Once the medics empty their medkits onto belts, you can make at least 6 medibots. Cargo can order emergency crates with floorbots and 2 medibots which will be useful to heal injured crew. Cleanbots are useless here, don't waste the metal on that. Mechs are rarely worth making, but if miners brought silver and the blob ate research, but not robotics? Make a durand, load it with a solaris and an energy relay and set it loose.

Xenobiologist: Though slimes take considerable time and luck to be useful, there are some things you can do to help out, from as simple as producing regen jelly (purple extracts) for medical, making sentient creatures or golems to do the fighting for you, equipment charging cross-breed extracts, mass-production of IED devices to blow that blob away, or even something crazy like swapping your mind with a blob zombie to see if you can claw the core to death! It all depends on both your creativity, and matching luck with the slimes.

[Geneticist](/jobs/science/geneticist): Most of your powers are of limited utility -- Hulk is only good if the blob is in a hard-to-reach place, pressure adaptation can be useful if the blob infested area is exposed to space, and TK is very useful for hurting the blob without risk. The ease of mass production, though, makes you a valuable tool. Rush some genes and maybe the blob won't win through spacing itself for the 600th time. 

### Engineering

Engineer: Drag some emitters out of Engineering Secure Storage (if there aren't any, you can afford to take some from the SM Chamber) and set them out pointing towards the blob. They can do some serious damage to the blob in the long run. If the blob is exposed to space, you can work on the blob from the outside and pose as a real annoyance.

Atmospheric Technician: Grab a welder and fight the blob. Don't you fucking dare try to plasma flood that blob. 

### Security

Grab lasers from the armory, unwrench some rechargers, set them out near the blob, pew pew pew pew. Pretty damn self-explanatory what you should be doing.
