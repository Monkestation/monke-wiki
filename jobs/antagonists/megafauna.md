# Megafauna
Megafauna are huge, extremely powerful creatures found in the planet of which the station is orbiting around. They emit a GPS Signal that is trackable by any GPS Device, so they are easy to avoid, as long as you're careful.

All types of megafauna will gut unconscious or dead victims, restoring their health by half of the creature's maximum health. 

# Lavaland

## Ash Drake

An enormous drake that roams the land. Once considered the easiest of Megafauna, code changes have made it into one of the most fierce opponents that can be found on Lavaland.

**GPS Signal**: "Fiery Signal"

**Statistics**
Health: 2500
Melee Damage: 40
Burn Resistance: 50%
Speed: Slow

### Behaviour

Normally, it chases its target trying to bite it. Whenever possible, it will also breathe fire in the three cardinal directions, dealing 20 burn damage and igniting whoever walks into the trail. It will send one trail directly at you and two more on either side of you, requiring a bit of tact to dodge it.
It's advisable to carry a fire extinguisher when fighting a drake, in case you can't avoid one of these.

The drake will also sometimes take flight and swoop down on a target, creating pooling lava below it and marking a 3x3 area before crushing anyone left inside, dealing 75 brute damage and gibbing unconscious targets. It will also send a standard firebreath attack at you as soon as it lands. The best way to deal with this attack is to stay on the move and keep your distance as it lands so that you have time to dodge the incoming fire.

As the drake gets damaged, swoop attacks will become more common, and the drake will begin using an additional attack.

If the drake falls below 50% health, it will use a special attack where it swoops up high and traps the target in a small arena of fire. One tile in the arena will be a safe spot, marked with a green rune. The rest of the tiles will turn into lava after a moment. This process will repeat 3 times before the attack ends. The drake will swoop back down and attempt to crush you in the standard 3x3 ring in the process.

### Loot

The drake leaves a carcass that can be butchered: it contains 5 Diamond ores, 5 Sinew, 10 Ash Drake Hide, and 30 Bones.

The Ash Drake Hide can be used to make the Ash Drake Armor. It has a 65% reduction in melee damage (potentially add another 10% additional reduction from a security jumpsuit), 70% reduction in explosive damage, 60% reduction in biological damage, 40% reduction in laser damage, 40% reduction in energy (shock) damage, 50% reduction in radiation damage, 15% reduction in bullet damage, and completely acid-, fire-, and ash-storm proof. Not spaceproof!

It will also drop a chest, which can contain one of the following:

- **Spectral Blade**: A sword that becomes more powerful with the amount of ghosts orbiting the wielder. The ghosts will also be visible while doing so, and can point but not talk.
- **Lava Staff**: A magic staff able to turn, after a brief channel, a tile of floor into 'weak' lava, or said 'weak' lava into basalt. Has a 10 seconds cooldown between uses (5 between reverts). It also doubles as a good melee weapon, with 18 burn damage per hit. 'Weak' lava applies half the lava damage and fire stacks (both at 10), and a quarter of the temperature (2500).
- **Spellbook of Sacred Flame**: Sacred Flame lights you and anyone around you on fire. Since you also get a fireproof suit by butchering a drake, it is a really powerful spell.
- **Bottle of Dragon's Blood**: When drunk, it has one of these effects:
  - Transforms the drinker into a dark red lizard with digitigrade legs, preventing the use of shoes.
  - Transforms the drinker into a skeleton, giving it a few racial bonuses.
  - Gives the drinker permanent immunity to lava.
  - Gives the drinker the ability to turn into a lesser ash drake (and back). To swoop, alt-click on a tile or target. **Remember: If you weren't one prior to becoming a drake, you are not an antagonist, and should not attack the crew!**
  
### How to Fight

Take your time and don't get greedy. Keep your distance and never stand in a cardinal direction from the drake so that you can more easily react to the incoming firebreath, coming in for shots in between the drakes attacks. Take only 1 or 2 shots at a time at the drake before you back up to prepare to dodge the incoming attack. Keep your distance when the drake is trying to crush you from up high so that you can avoid the incoming fire. Keep your cool and stay focused during the fire arena attack, messing this attack up is extremely difficult to recover from. The drake will not immediately breathe fire at you when it lands from the fire arena attack, giving you a window to get a couple quick hits in. Still be prepared to retreat though, its next attack will come out pretty quickly after landing. Unless you are very robust and experienced, do not attempt this fight without several regenerative cores and healing pens. Here's a general list of to-do's to make this fight simple:

Fire Breath:

- Shoot drake twice, run away so the distance between you and the drake is a straight line.

- Drake shoots fire, take one step out of the way.

- Repeat.

Lava Chase:

- Just run away in a straight line.

- When the drake lands, take one step out of the way, then go shoot him.

Fire Spiral:

- See this move, just back away. He's guaranteed to do this three times in a row, with the first blast being slightly off, then head on, then slightly off, so dodge accordingly and you can get one shot in between each attack.

- Shoot him after the 3rd spiral.

Lava Arena:

- Just stand on the green space. Press the movement buttons individually so you don't mess up the inputs, you should always have enough time.

- This happens 3 times, back up once the walls go down.

- You are now guarenteed 4 hits with a base KA before the drake does any other moves.

## Colossus

A huge, towering being. Slow, but extremely dangerous. 

**GPS Signal**: "Angelic Signal"
**Statistics**

Health: 2500
Melee Damage: 40
Burn Resistance: 50%
Speed: Slow 

### Behaviour

The Colossus, when attacking, shoots Death Bolts in different patterns, telegraphing each burst with a screen shake and a red flash.
Death bolts are slow, and deal 25 brute damage ignoring armor. They'll break rocks, and if on station, walls and reinforced walls on hit.

Patterns:

- Random Shots: The colossus shoots a random amount of bolts aiming in random directions.
- Blast: Shoots a shotgun-like blast of death bolts.
- Directional Shots: Shoots bolts in the 8 cardinal directions.
- Alternating Directional Shots: Shoots bolts alternating between a + shape and an X shape, four times.
- Spiral Shot: Shoots following a spiral around the Colossus. Becomes more frequent as the Colossus loses health. The Colossus screams: "Judgement".
- Double Spiral: Only used when the colossus is below 33% health, shoots two opposite spirals at the same time. The Colossus screams: "Die".

When shot, the Colossus will display glowing yellow shields, but they are cosmetic and do not in fact reduce the damage it takes.

If challenged by someone using Sleeping Carp, the Colossus will enrage and chase him down.

### Loot

The colossus drops two items: the Voice of God and the Anomalous Crystal.

#### Voice of God

You'll know how to use this thing. Just surgically implant it into the mouth and you're off to the races. Just know that anyone that's deaf, wearing earmuffs, holding antimagic items or if you're silenced via a variety of means.

#### Anomalous Crystal

An anomalous crystal's activation method and effect is random, and must be tested to find out what it does.

Possible activation methods:

- On touch: Using the crystal with an empty hand will trigger it.
- On bump: Moving against the crystal will trigger it.
- On weapon: Hitting the crystal with anything will trigger it.
- On heat: Hitting the crystal with a weapon that can ignite will trigger it. (I.E. welders, lighters)
- On speech: Speaking near the crystal will trigger it.
- On bomb: Explosions, no matter how weak, will trigger it. Also triggered by Kinetic Accelerator hits.
- On laser: Laser-like shots will trigger it. (Includes disablers, practice and laser tag gun lasers too)
- On bullet: Physical bullets will trigger it. (Also includes syringe gun syringes)
- On energy: Energy shots will trigger it. (Includes energy bolas, somatorays, ions)

Possible Effects:

- HONK: After a delay of 3 seconds, whoever activated and remained within line-of-sight. will drop all his equipment and become a clown, with starting equipment included. If this effect is picked, it's only activated by bump or speech.
- Theme Warp: After a 5-second delay, transforms the theme of the room the crystal is in, morphing the floor, tables and chairs and spawning some flora, then put in a 20s cooldown. Possible themes are Lavaland, Winter, Jungle and Abductor. Activated by touch.
- Emitter: The crystal shoots a colossus' death bolt. Activated by touch; cooldown of 5 seconds.
- Dark Reprise: Revives any corpses nearby as shadowpeople after a 5-second delay. The crystal can resurrect people multiple times. Activated by touch.
- Lightgeists: Once activated and after a delay of 5 seconds, the crystal will allow ghosts to spawn as lightgeists, extremely fragile jelly-like beings that cannot speak and can heal people. Activated by touch.
- Possession: The crystal will transfer your mind and body into any harmless animal close to the crystal. If no animals are in range, the crystal will spawn a cockroach. Once inside the animal, you can get out at any time, but it will gib the animal's body. If the animal dies while you're possessing it, you'll die as well. Activated by touch; 1-second delay.

### How to Fight

People claim to have trouble with this boss, but he's pretty easy as long as you don't get hit. For this boss, it's usually preferable to clear out an arena first with normal mining tools (or his own projectiles!) Some miners use the far south part of lavaland for wide open fighting space, but stray projectiles will tear the mining station to shreds if this is done.

- Shotgun: The end of many miners, Colossus shouts "Retribution" before firing a quick spray of death bolts.

- Circle: Just a bunch of death bolts in a circle, easier to dodge, there are very clear openings.

- Cardinals: Just slowly shoots death bolts in cardinal and then alternate cardinal with it changing each attack, does this 4 times before going back to a normal pattern, pretty easy to get one or two hits in here.

- Judgement: Easy, just stay to the side of him, as soon as you see the death bolt come out on your side, move up and go in to shoot. By the time it rotates back around to shoot, you should have walked away again and be ready to go back in to shoot in the same way. Just keep moving up or down and be sure to keep moving to stay away from the colossus, don't get trapped against the lava or rocks.

- Die: Same thing as Judgement, except two spirals start at both sides, this causes the sides to have two attacks coming out, you have two options here. The easier option is to now change to being below or above the colossus, if you're above or below it's basically just judgement since both the death bolts are on one tile, try not to get hit though or you'll be hurting. The second one is to stay to the side, and move in after two shots are fire, the timing on this one is way less forgiving, and you need to fire before you're in range so it shoots by the time you're running to not get hit.

- Triple Shotgun: Same thing as before, this is the reason you don't go in after the shotgun attacks EVER. Looks like a normal shotgun, but is always shot in patterns of 3, these attacks have way less cooldown than if it was a normal shotgun with a normal shotgun attack right after it, you can get shots inbetween these, but I'd recommend against it unless you're comfortable.

- All of the death bolts rip through all armor, good luck.

## Bubblegum

A fleshy monstrosity, making the earth tremble with every step it takes. In what passes for a hierarchy among slaughter demons, this one is king. 

**GPS Signal**: "Bloody Signal"
**Statistics**

Health: 2500
Melee Damage: 40
Burn Resistance: 50%
Speed: Slow 

### Behavior

Bubblegum's fight is centered on blood: never stand on a bloodied tile if you can help it. Standing on blood also provokes Bubblegum, which, if Bubblegum somehow gets onto the station, can prove catastrophic. Bubblegum, as it walks around, leaves blood trails wherever it goes. Its hallucinations also leave blood trails, leading to an often unmanageable amount of blood. Occasionally, Bubblegum will spray blood towards an entity which it is hostile to. This blood spray will go through walls, and can also travel in non-cardinal directions.

Bubblegum will attempt to hit a target in melee if it is able to; if it cannot, it will start its attack cycle. Whilst Bubblegum is not in an attack cycle, it will move erratically, rather than moving directly towards a hostile entity. This makes Bubblegum rather annoying to fight against, as you have to chase it around.

### Attacks

- Rend: Bubblegum's attack cycle first prioritizes rending up to 2 targets who are standing on a blood tile. These are pretty easy to dodge, as long as you keep moving.

- Charge: Bubblegum charges slightly behind an entity which it is hostile to. Whilst it is charging, seven slightly transparent bubblegum hallucinations are created, which all charge towards the entity's former position. The eighth direction will be occupied by Bubblegum itself. These hallucinations, if it hits an entity, does a single attack, and when the hallucinations reach the center "target," they de-manifest. Getting hit by a hallucination is more forgiving than getting hit by Bubblegum itself, as the hallucinations deal lower damage and, since they pass through entities, can't follow up to attacks with melee attacks or rending through blood. These hallucinations also leave blood trails behind. The good news is that you can shoot at these hallucinations, which only have 1 health, and therefore die to anything. When Bubblegum is below half health, he will start to manifest several hallucination "waves" consecutively. As Bubblegum's health decreases, he will also start charging more, and charging quicker.

- Enrage: Occasionally, Bubblegum will crawl into blood, emerging from another tile with blood on it. Bubblegum will then enter an enraged mode, which is indicated by him becoming dark red rather than pink. Whilst in this mode, he will perform 3 consecutive charges, with each charge being aimed slightly behind the player. Any entity which gets within 1 tile of Bubblegum will have damage dealt to it and will get thrown. Be aware, if you get thrown into a wall, you will get stunned, which is essentially a guaranteed death sentence. While enraged, Bubblegum will also deflect any projectiles.

### Loot

Not writing this section up as I'm certain almost all the loot is gone because of self-antaggers! Joy!

### How to Fight

Bubblegum is pretty hard at the moment. The best way to fight it is to lure it to a large arena, unless you want to get fucked by gibtonite. Whenever Bubblegum charges you, run the opposite way. As long as you're at full movement speed, Bubblegum cannot hit you if you run in a straight line when he does his triple charge. When it does its eight hallucination charge, moving one tile to the side and continuing to move straight will dodge it. After each charge move, Bubblegum waits a bit before doing its next charge attack, leaving room for one or two hits. 

## Legion

A horrifying, enormous skull, that is summoned when you knock on the doors of the necropolis. Upon being released, it will immediately aggro onto the person who opened the doors. 

**GPS Signal**: "Echoing Signal"

**Statistics**
Stages: 3
Stage 1 Health: 700
Stage 2 Health: 350
Stage 3 Health: 200
Total Health: 3400
Melee Damage: 25
Burn Resistance: 50%
Speed: Very Slow 

### Behaviour

Legion's behavior is rather simple. Each skull has 3 attacks. Stage 1 skulls attack more and are more aggressive than Stage 3 skulls. Each skull goes through its own attack cycle, so it's likely that each skull will be doing its own attack.

- Spawn Skull: The most common attack. Rather self-explanatory. It spawns a tiny legion skull, which chases the player. Essentially just an annoyance. Legion generally will move away from the player, making it a pain to hit.

- Spawn Sentinel: The skull spawns a varying amount of sentinels, depending on their stage. Stage 1 Legion spawns 3 sentinels, Stage 2 spawns 2 sentinels, Stage 3 spawns a single sentinel. Sentinels are stationary turrets with 80 health which deal 19 burn damage to anyone who gets too close.

- Charge: You can tell when a legion skull is charging when it starts spinning and moves consistently towards its target. What's dangerous about this attack is that the legion skull will "flick" itself short distances towards its target, dealing its melee damage to whatever it hits. This means that you have to maintain a considerable distance in order to remain reasonably safe, which is a tough order when you're dealing with multiple skulls. Upon completing its charge, it will retreat a couple of tiles before attacking again.

When a Legion is killed, it splits into three smaller Legions, with less health, but the same attacks and damage. This process repeats two times, then the smallest (Stage 3) skulls will shatter into bone. 

### Loot

Every time you shatter a skull (when it's too small to split) there's a 20% chance of it dropping a necropolis tendril loot chest. On average, you should be getting about 2 chests when you fully kill off legion.

When the last piece of Legion is destroyed, it spawns a Staff of Storms. Like the Lava Staff, this doubles as a robust melee weapon, with 20 burn damage on hit. It also has a fairly sizeable wound bonus, but it is bulky and can only be held or dragged. It can summon a lightning bolt after a three second telegraphed delay, dealing 20 damage (60 to fauna) and causing a small fire. It has 3 charges, recharging one each 15 seconds. If used in an area with an on-going weather effect (e.g., ash storms, rad storms), the bolt is empowered, doubling the damage to mobs, an explosion (range of 1) and expends the fire range to 2.

### How to Fight

Firstly, the use of an AOE KA upgrade is highly recommended. It allows you to potentially hit multiple skulls at once, and it makes shooting at the mini-skulls/sentinels somewhat worthwhile. Also, because of the sentinels, fighting in an arena isn't really worthwhile. It's better to just kite it down to the bottom of lavaland. When Legion splits, DISENGAGE. Run far enough away so that the skulls lose aggro on you. Then, come back, and aggro only a single one of the skulls. When you kill it, aggro another Stage 2 skull. Fighting 3 Stage 2 skulls, and eventually 9 Stage 3 skulls, at the same time, for questionable rewards, is definitely not worth it, especially since you can just cheese them out. 

## Blood-Drunk Miner

"A miner destined to wander forever, engaged in an endless hunt." 

**GPS Signal**: "Resonant Signal"
**Statistics**
Health: 900
Melee Damage: 20
Speed: Medium

### Behavior

Effectively a highly aggressive miner, the blood-drunk miner has very few attacks but compensates by being highly aggressive.

The blood-drunk miner's attacks are as follows

- If not in KA range, it will rapidly dash at its target
- If in KA range, it will fire its kinetic accelerator
- If in melee range, will rapidly attack, akin to an actual player
- After any of these attacks, may transform its cleaving saw:

Untransformed, it attacks very rapidly for smaller amounts of damage
Transformed, it attacks at normal speed for higher damage and cleaves enemies hit

### Loot

When the blood-drunk miner dies, it leaves behind the cleaving saw it was using, a number of KA upgrade disks, and its kinetic accelerator. Its Cleaving Saw can be toggled between two modes: open, and closed. While the saw is open, it will deal a wide range of AOE damage around the user. However, it attacks somewhat slowly in this mode. While the saw is closed, it will attack a single target extremely quickly, causing a high amount of damage in a short amount of time. Both modes will build up existing bleed effects to mining mobs, doing a burst of high damage if the bleed is built up high enough. Transforming it immediately after an attack causes the next attack to come out faster.

### How to Fight

This guy's pretty easy actually. Recommended KA setup for this one is 1x Range, 2x Cooldown. Someone did the math, and found that as long as you can somewhat aim, cooldown mods on a KA deals significantly more DPS than damage mods. Also you really don't need 2x Range mods unless you are new to kiting. Don't be greedy, don't get caught out when he teleports. If you get down to yellow health on your doll, run away and disengage. If you're experienced, you can probably get by with only using sutures and a legion core. It should be noted that he'll only teleport if you get far enough away from him, so if you want to end the fight quickly, you should stay only just out of his KA range.

- Dig a large tunnel that loops back on itself
- Kite boss to tunnel
- Keep running and fire behind you

If you're going crusher, this should be the first boss you kill.

If you have fully upgraded armor, this guy's melee attack friggin tickles. Get up in his face, pop a mining pen, and murder him with the weapon of your choice. 

## Hierophant

"A massive metal club that hangs in the air as though waiting. It'll make you dance to its beat." 

**GPS Signal**: "Zealous Signal"
**Statistics**
Health: 2500
Melee Damage: 15
Speed: Slow

### Behavior

The Hierophant spawns in its arena, which makes fighting it challenging but not impossible.

The text this boss speaks is ROT4, use ROT22 to decode

The Hierophant's attacks are as follows;

- These attacks happen at a random, increasing chance:

  -If target is at least 2 tiles away; Blinks to the target after a very brief delay, damaging everything near the start and end points.
  -As above, but does so multiple times if below half health.
  -Rapidly creates cardinal and diagonal Cross Blasts under a target.
  -If chasers are off cooldown, creates 4 chasers.

- IF TARGET IS OUTSIDE THE ARENA: Creates an arena around the target for 10 seconds, blinking to the target if not in the created arena.

  - The arena has a 20 second cooldown, giving people a small window to get the fuck out.

- If no chasers exist, creates a chaser that will seek its target, leaving a trail of blasts.

  - Is more likely to create a second, slower, chaser if hurt.

- If the target is at least 2 tiles away, may Blink to the target after a very brief delay, damaging everything near the start and end points.
  - Creates a cardinal or diagonal blast(Cross Blast) under its target, exploding after a short time.

- If below half health, the created Cross Blast may fire in all directions.
  - Creates an expanding AoE burst.
  - IF ATTACKING IN MELEE: Creates an expanding AoE burst in addition to using other ranged attacks.

Cross Blasts and the AoE burst gain additional range as Hierophant loses health, while Chasers gain additional speed.

When Hierophant dies, it stops trying to murder you and shrinks into a small form, which, while much weaker, is still quite effective. - The smaller club can place a teleport beacon, allowing the user to teleport themselves and their allies to the beacon.

Difficulty: Hard

### Loot

When the Hierophant is defeated, it will let out one final huge expanding burst attack that will fill about half the arena. After this, the Hierophant will fall to the ground as an item, allowing you to loot and wield it as the Hierophant's Club Hierophantsclub.gif. The club allows you to instantly teleport to a target location within 5 tiles, on a 15 second cooldown. It also comes with a beacon that can be detached with a HUD button, allowing you to teleport yourself and anyone standing next to you back to the detached beacon from any location.

### How to Fight

This fight is all about reaction time. Try to stay on the move often to avoid taking damage from the chasers, and when using a ranged weapon try to stay at least 1 tile away from the Hierophant so that it won't use its large AoE burst. When it begins a rapid attack, try not to panic. This attack has been the bane of many miners before. Remain calm and pay close attention to where the tiles are spawning, and you should be okay. Note that unlike most megafauna, this one will almost never bring you from full health to dead right away. There are a lot of attacks, and some of them can be hard to dodge, but they deal fairly low damage. The attacks only deal damage when they turn white (from purple). Having a few stable legion cores makes this fight considerably easier.

### Alternatively, Cheesing It

- Bug xenobio to send you a sentient slime to throw at Hiero (assuming there is no random BZ in the lavaland atmos)
- Xeno slimes heal from burn damage, and Hiero is only capable of burn damage
- Profit

The crusher way

- Max our your armor
- Use deluxe medpen
- Attack hierophant until it dies (don't forget to move around it to get backstabs).
