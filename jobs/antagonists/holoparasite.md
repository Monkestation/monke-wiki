A holoparasite, also known by its magic variant as a guardian spirit, is a special being that is bound to the single person that summoned it. It is summoned through either a deck of tarot cards for the magic version or a parasitic nanomachine injector for the machine version. The nanomachine injector can be purchased by traitors.

The only difference between the magic and tech versions are their summon methods and appearance. They both have access to the same abilities. This means that traitors can get an ally that Wizards are also able to get! 

A holoparasite is a special ghost-like being that lives inside of its master. It can communicate with its master telepathically with a hud icon (and the master can communicate back with a button under the new guardian tab), as well as emerge from and retreat back into its master at will. If the Holoparasite tries to escape its master and moves too far away, it will automatically be moved back to them. The Holoparasite itself is technically invincible on its own, but upon taking damage, the damage is transferred to its master, albeit at a lower amount. If the master dies, the spirit dies, as well. When the user dies, their body is instantly consumed and dusted by the Holoparasite's need for their life energy. This means that the master and the spirit will have to watch out for each other to ensure the survival of both. 

# Types of Holoparasites

When summoned, depending on which item was used the summoner can choose between several different types of spirits/holoparasites/power miners. Each have their own abilities, advantages, and drawbacks. The summoned spirit/holopara will then be able to customize their name and color. 

- Traitor's holoparasite injector creates a holoparasite. User gets to choose type.
- Wizard's guardian deck creates a guardian. User gets to choose type.
- Miner's dusty shard creates a power miner. Type is random.

## Standard

The classic ~~JoJoke~~ combat powerhouse. Deals devastating close combat attacks by rapidly hitting the target, and has high damage resist. Can smash through weak walls.

The Standard Holoparasite also has access to some minor customization: The Holoparasite can select a Battle Cry that they will automatically shout over and over upon attacking. This is limited to six letters. For instance, putting in "ORA" for the battle cry will make you shout

"ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA!!"

## Assassin

Does medium damage and takes full damage, but can enter stealth, causing its next attack to do massive damage and ignore armor. However, it becomes briefly unable to recall after attacking from stealth.

## Gaseous

Can expel its choice of gas into the atmosphere, from the benign options of O2, N2, and CO2, to the annoying BZ (which causes hallucinations) and H2O (which makes the floor slippery), to the incredibly dangerous options of N2O (knocks people out!) or Plasma (toxic and flammable!). Its punches cause sparks (VERY dangerous combined with plasma) and it automatically keeps it's users temperature stable and extinguishes them.


## Charger

Moves extremely fast, does medium damage on attack, and can charge at targets, damaging the first target hit and forcing them to drop any items they are holding.

## Explosive

High damage resist and medium power attack. Can turn any object, including objects too large to pick up, into a bomb by alt-clicking them, dealing explosive damage to the next person to touch it. The object will return to normal after the trap is triggered or after a delay. Examining a trapped item will say "It glows with a strange light ! ".

## Gravitokinetic

Normal speed, attack damage and damage resistances. Attacks will apply a field of heavy gravity on the target, slowing them and making them drop held items. Can alt-click ground to manually place heavy gravity fields. Recalling or moving over 10 tiles away from the fields will remove them.

## Lightning

Attacks apply lightning chains to targets. Has a lightning chain to the user. Lightning chains shock everything near them, doing constant damage.

## Protector

Causes you to teleport to it when out of range. Has two modes:

- Combat

It does and takes medium damage.

- Protection

It does and takes almost no damage but moves slightly slower.


## Ranged

Has two modes, and can lay surveillance snares, which alert it when crossed. The second one fires a constant stream of weak, armor-ignoring projectiles.


## Dexterous

Does low damage on attack, but is capable of holding items and storing a single item within it. It will drop items held in its hands when it recalls, but it will retain the stored item.


## Support

Has two modes, and can deploy a bluespace beacon and warp targets to it (including your host). Deploy a beacon by clicking its verb in your guardian tab. Then teleport people by alt-clicking them. Teleporting is not instant.


## Healer

Heals instead of damages, but has low damage resist and slow movement.
