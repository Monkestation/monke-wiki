Nanotrasen's contracted you to hunt down some fugitives, and damnit, you've got to enforce THE LAW. 

# Objectives

- Major Fugitive Victory: All of the fugitives survived and avoided capture!
- Fugitive Victory: A fugitive survived, and no bodies were recovered by the hunters.
- Minor Fugitive Victory: All the fugitives died, but none were recovered!
- Stalemate: Everyone died, and no fugitives were recovered!
- Minor Security Victory: All the hunters died, but managed to capture a fugitive, dead or alive.
- Security Victory: The hunters managed to capture a fugitive, dead or alive.
- Major Security Victory: The hunters managed to capture every fugitive, dead or alive.
- Badass Security Victory: These extraordinary hunters managed to capture every fugitive, alive!
- Postmortem Security Victory: The hunters managed to capture every fugitive, but all of them died! Spooky!

# SpacePol

- Flavor Text: "Justice has arrived. I am a member of the Spacepol! The criminals should be on the station, we have special huds implanted to recognize them. As we have lost pretty much all power over these damned lawless megacorporations, it's a mystery if their security will cooperate with us."

Moderately well armed, start with a pistol which they can use to apprehend suspects.

# Russians

- Flavor Text: "Ay blyat. I am a space-russian smuggler! We were mid-flight when our cargo was beamed off our ship! We were hailed by a man in a green uniform, promising the safe return of our goods in exchange for a favor: There is a local station housing fugitives that the man is after, he wants them returned; dead or alive. We will not be able to make ends meet without our cargo, so we must do as he says and capture them."

Their numbers are great, but they spawn with bad gear, and they all get Mosin-Nagant Surplus Rifles. Unfortunately, these rifles are invariably lethal, bulky, and have to be manually reloaded. You could probably use it as a budget disabler, if you count shooting a guy's leg off as a nonlethal method.

# Bounty Hunters

- Flavor Text: "We got a new bounty on some fugitives, dead or alive."

A small team of hunters which are armed with exotic weaponry. For example, they gain access to traps, which only activate when a fugitive steps on it, and is otherwise harmless to the rest of the crew. When it's activated, it blares out its location to all bounty hunters. The bounty hunters are also moderately well armed, with access to flamethrowers and double-barreled shotguns.
