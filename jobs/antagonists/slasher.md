So, if you're looking here, odds are you have a welding mask stuck to your face, an apron that feels heavy enough to be robust armor, and you have a desire to kill. This is the page for you. If you're hearing breathing and seeing lights pop everywhere, this is gonna be more an informational page for you to save yourself.

The Slasher's job is pretty simple: you know the Halloween horror films? That's where the name comes from. Freddy Kreuger, Jason, Leatherface... all familiar names to anyone that appreciates good horror. You're a spooky villain. Think and act like one. As of the time of this guide being written (1/9/24), there are no fixed objectives. But we will go over how to do stuff.

# The Basics

You're always going to be some sort of a Human (unless there is badmin intervention). So don't be alarmed if you're suddenly not who you normally are. You will be starting off with next to zero gear outside your clothes. You will have a random jumpsuit, a set of industrial boots, the butcher's apron and a slasher's gas mask (it looks like a welding mask). The only thing that you can take off at all is the uniform. Everything else is stuck to you unless you are dismembered. 

Non-slashers, please note that if you pick up any of these items, they will be stuck to your hand and you will have to have the limb amputated to fix it!

You will always have a VHS style filter in your view. This also applies to any other players that are within 1 screens reach of you (aka if they could see you at all sans line of sight they will have the filter). You will also automatically breathe in and breathe out periodically that helps sell the villain that you are supposed to be. Oh, and you'll also automatically pop lights at random around you and spread gibs everywhere. Don't be surprised if a janitor decides to "validhunt" you for making a huge mess. Oh and Medical will hate you for causing disease everywhere because of the disease.

Another disadvantage you will find as the Slasher is that you will not be able to eat anything because of the mask. So finding ways to get more food into you will be a long term survival thing. Blending 

# Abilities

Let's talk abilities.

## Blood Trail

- Begin trailing blood in your wake! Spooky!
- 15 second active time, 30 second cooldown

On it's own, it's relatively benign. But as the amount of blood and shit gets worse, it'll cause all sorts of secondary effects. And if there's something like a Slaughter Demon going around, they'll absolutely LOVE having this blood being spread around by you!

## Incorporealize

- Become incorporeal, capable of moving through walls and being completely invisible, but unable to interact with the world. Can only be used when corporeal and when not in view of any human being.
- 2 seconds to activate, 20 second cooldown after activation.

This is the bread and butter of how to get around without having access. One important note is that while you may become incorporeal, you are still subject to oxygen and pressure loss damage, so be careful about *how* you move. Granted, the mask does allow you to hook up a small tank in your pocket so you can get around without worrying about air. Surely you can figure out the pressure problem.

## Summon Machete

- Summon your machete to your active hand, or create one if it doesn't exist. This machete deals 15 BRUTE on hit increasing by 2.5 for every soul you own, and stuns on throw.
- 15 second cooldown, immediate activation.

The slashing part of Slasher. The machete is a power house of a weapon that has multiple uses tied to it, between attacking people, stunning them, all sorts of things. And because of the haunted effects of the machete, you don't have to worry about someone trying to use it against you! A perfect weapon! Your other abilities of Soul Steal and Haunt is how you power this thing up!

## Regenerate

- Quickly regenerate your being, restoring most if not all lost health, repairing wounds, and removing all stuns.
- 15 second active time, 75 second cooldown.

This ability is going to be your survival tool. If you're a mess but you escape, you can use this to get back to full health rather quickly. The antistun is helpful to get out too!

## Soul Steal

- You can use this ability to suck souls. You can only do this ability if you are not incorporeal.
- Click to activate then click on someone that's alive! You can't use this on non-players!

You use this ability on someone to take their "soul". It's that simple!

## Stalk Target

- Get a target to stalk, standing near them for three minutes will rip their soul from their body. YOU MUST PROTECT THEM FROM HARM.
- 3 minute cooldown.

Stalking is a tad more robust than the outright soul steal as it kinda lets you protect someone while they are alive. The stalk target will be an alive player somewhere on your Z level.

## Screech of Terror

- Inflict near paralyzing fear to those around you.
- Immediate activation, 45 second cooldown.

This causes people to hit the floor, shake and scream. This will temporarily stun everyone else near by!

# Tips
- Think like a movie villain! Seriously, it helps! If you need inspiration, watch the classic slasher films out there to get a sense of what things can help you out.
- You have full speech of Galactic Common! Feel free to terrorize the crew with intercoms!
- Remember that your machete can stun people when its thrown at someone! You can then use your seemingly unholy strength to pick them up and drag them off!
- Remember, KILLING isn't something you explicitly have to do! Being spooky or even hangin' folk on meathooks deep in maintenance can be a terrorizing experience!
