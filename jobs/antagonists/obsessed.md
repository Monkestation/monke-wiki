Apparently spinning around on a heaving death hulk in the middle of space doesn't do wonders for one's sanity. Bummer. When one snaps, they usually turn to the Syndicate for an escape from the madness. But, one's motivations rarely follow reason... 

# Objectives

> YOU ARE STILL SUBJECT TO NON ANTAG RULES. Follow your objectives and escalation rules.
{.is-warning}


Upon rolling obsessed, you gain a total of three miscellaneous unique objectives from the five below that you have to complete.

- Spend Time: Pretty self-explanatory, spend five minutes during which your target can "see" you. Emphasize the "see", you can run around in a potted plant and it still counts for the timer. If you're unsure whether you're close enough (or within line of sight), check your moodlet modifiers.
- Take a Picture: Be in possession of a photo containing your alive target in frame.
- Hug: Hug your target four to six times while they're still alive.
- Heirloom: Steal your target's heirloom. This objective can only be chosen if your target has the Family Heirloom quirk.
- Jealous Murder: Kill one of your target's coworkers (someone in the same department as your obsession). Note, an Assistant is counted within the Service department. This objective can only be rolled if there is someone in the same department as your target asides from you.

Once all three of your secondary objectives are completed, you can then proceed to your primary objective:

- Murder: Kill your obsession.

After that's done with, you revert back to being a normal, non-antagonist crew member.

# Curing Obsession

An obsessed crewmember, if they are suitably subdued (Nanotrasen security experts recommend using N2O as a sedative to reduce morale reducing tirades), can be cured from their obsession by conducting a lobotomy, which can be performed at a surgery table connected to an operating console once Advanced Surgery has been researched by Science. Do note that brain surgery is not sufficient to cure the obsessed brain trauma, as it is deep-rooted, and that lobotomization often results in other, permanent brain traumas as collateral. If in doubt as to whether an obsession has been cured, just examine their mood, whilst sanity will stay low, mood will immediately slingshot back up from abysmally low to neutral or even slightly positive. 

# Tips

- The most important thing to keep track of is your mood. When away from your obsession, your mood tanks heavily, and if you're depressed for long enough, your sanity decreases (despite the fact that you really don't have one in the first place, do you?). On the other hand, when next to your obsession, your mood goes up rapidly, and if it's high enough, you start speaking giddily (which is a dead giveaway that you're Obsessed). Whilst sanity is dependent on mood, mood is not dependent on sanity, and therefore it is possible to speak giddily whilst still having your sanity slow your movement speed down to a crawl.
- Asides from that, your job is really keeping Security off your back for as long as possible. If you're a part of Security in the first place, or a head of staff, your job is made quite easy. Same for if you share the same department with your obsession. However, if you're an Assistant, and your obsession happens to be the Warden, well, tough luck, it's hard to craft enough excuses such that you can fulfill your objectives without getting locked up.
- You should do your objectives in order of how suspicious they are. For example, if you have the objectives of spending time around your obsession and stealing their heirloom, doing one of them has your target raising an eyebrow in suspicion, and the other has them yelling for Security.
- Taking a picture of your Obsession can be done covertly (if you're a human) by Law 2-ing the Station AI or a Cyborg, assuming that your target is a non-human. The Cyborg camera spits it right out, which it then has to drag to you, which is mighty suspicious. Therefore, it's probably best to ask the AI to take the photo, which it can then PDA to you. Upon receiving that photo, you can then print it out.
