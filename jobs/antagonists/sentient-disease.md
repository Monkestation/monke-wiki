You are a sentient virus, extremely adaptable and resistant to mutations, which has somehow gotten established on this particular Nanotrasen brand space station. 

# Becoming a Sentient Disease

There is a low chance that a random event will take place which will spawn a sentient disease on station. This sentient disease starts off by infecting only a single host, a "Patient Zero" if you will, and has to move quickly to infect as many people as possible. The disease then has to endure the rest of the shift (with the CMO and virologist probably hot on your ass) in order to maximize its chances of getting a host to CentCom. There's no official notification for the spawning of a sentient disease, so the first few infections should be easy. (especially considering that your infection modifier is relatively stable) 

# Objectives 

All sentient diseases have the same two, non-varying objectives:

- Survive and infect as many people as possible.
- Ensure that at least one infected host escapes on the shuttle or an escape pod.

# Plague, Inc.

The Sentient Disease spawns with 0 evolution points, gaining more as it infects more hosts. A good portion of the symptoms listed here can be evolved, but not all of them. (imagine how terrifying a sentient disease with brain rot would be) One trait which differentiates a sentient disease from a normal, virology disease is that the sentient disease can evolve more than 6 symptoms.

The sentient disease has two unique abilities:

- Cough: This ability forces the host that the virus is following to cough, transmitting the virus two tiles away from the host. Costs no evolution points, and is the only symptom you receive upon spawn. Your main source of transmission in the first few minutes of your existence. There is a 10 second cooldown before this ability can be used again.
- Sneeze: This ability forces the host that the virus is following to sneeze, transmitting the virus four tiles away in a cone to the front of your host. Costs 3 evolution points, and is therefore relatively easy to unlock. 20 seconds cooldown between uses.

Evolvable Symptoms (WARNING: This table is massively out of date; just read the in-game descriptions in your sentient disease menu(s) while you wait for your mutation cooldown to finish)

| Symptom               | Cost  | Description |
|-----------------------|-------|-----|
| Voluntary Coughing    | 0     | Force the host you are following to cough with extra force,  spreading your infection to those within two meters of your host even if  your transmitability is low. Cooldown: 10 seconds |
| Voluntary Sneezing    | 3     | Force the host you are following to sneeze with extra force,  spreading your infection to any victims in a 4 meter cone in front of  your host. Cooldown: 20 seconds |
| Involuntary Coughing  | 4     | Cause victims to cough intermittently. |
| Involuntary Sneezing  | 4     | Cause victims to sneeze intermittently, spreading your infection and  also increasing transmitability and resistance, at the cost of stealth. |
| Beard Growth          | 8     | Cause all victims to grow a luscious beard. Decreases stats slightly. Ineffective against Santa Claus. |
| Hallucinations        | 8     | Cause victims to hallucinate. Decreases stats, especially resistance. |
| Choking               | 8     | Cause victims to choke, threatening asphyxiation. Decreases stats, especially transmittability. |
| Confusion             | 8     | Cause victims to become confused intermittently. |
| Eternal Youth         | 8     | Cause victims to become eternally young. Provides boosts to all stats except transmittability. |
| Vomiting              | 8     | Cause victims to vomit. Slightly increases transmittability.  Vomiting also also causes the victims to lose nutrition and removes some  toxin damage. |
| Voice Changing        | 8     | Change the voice of victims, causing confusion in communications. |
| Vision Loss           | 8     | Damage the eyes of victims, eventually causing blindness. Decreases all stats. |
| Self-Adaptation       | 8     | Cause your infection to mimic the function of normal body cells,  becoming much harder to spot and to eradicate, but reducing its speed. |
| Skin Paleness         | 8     | Cause victims to become pale. Decreases all stats. |
| Sensory Restoration   | 8     | Regenerate eye and ear damage of victims. |
| Itching               | 8     | Cause victims to itch, increasing all stats except stealth. |
| Weight Loss           | 8     | Cause victims to lose weight, and make it almost impossible for them  to gain nutrition from food. Reduced nutrition allows your infection to  spread more easily from hosts, especially by sneezing.  |
| Itching               | 8     | Cause victims to itch, increasing all stats except stealth. |
| Metabolic Boost       | 16    | Increase the metabolism of victims, causing them to process chemicals twice as fast and grow hungry more quickly. |
| Regenerative Coma     | 16    | Cause victims to fall into a healing coma when hurt. |

Statistics

Each evolved symptom affects 4 stats; stealth, transmission, resistance, and stage speed, which all can change how your disease interacts.

# Oh Shit There's a Sentient Disease on Station

- Step 1: Turn on internals
- Step 2: Make sure that the virologist/CMO is alive
- Step 3: Wait for him/her to do work and make vaccines (provided they weren't lynched for the disease appearing in the first place)

Of worth noting is that viruses can, and often will go become beneficial to the crew, but it almost always requires purchasing various negative symptoms to increase the transmissibility enough so you can actually evolve Regenerative Coma or Sensory Restoration/whatever. Spaceallin can also be useful if you are already infected by the disease.
