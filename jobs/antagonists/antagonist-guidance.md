# Antagonist Guidance
If you are coming here, you are looking for some guidance on whether something is ok or something is not ok, at least as far as server rules and admin opinion is concerned. This shall serve as a resource for both admins and for players in order to gauge what they want to do and whether they have gotten to that point or not.

But remember... *being an antagonist is a privledge, not a right*.

First off, definitions!

### Valid
Short for "valid to kill".

### Validhunting

Hunting antagonists as non-security or as a job that isn't allowed to hunt down a particular antagonist. Deputized individuals are considered security and are allowed to engage.

## The Table

| Antagonist         | Valid Huntable | Escalation Required | Notes  |
|--------------------|----------------|---------------------|------|

| Head Revolutionary | Y              | N                   | All Mindshielded Crew can hunt you|
| Blood Cultist      | Y, See Notes   | N, See Notes        | The Cults should focus on conversions and avoid murder unless the murder is required. Halos on Blood Cultists are 100% valid.|
| Clockwork Cultist  | Y, See Notes   | N, See Notes        | The Cults should focus on conversions and avoid murder unless the murder is required.|

| Space Dragon       | Y              | N                   | High Threat, can end a round quickly if played well|
| Space Pirates      | Y              | N                   | Pirates are there for a purpose: LOOT! Any killin' outside a plunderin' and defendin' yer haul ain't looked on wisely!|
| Xenomorphs         | Y              | N                   | Xenos.|
| Nightmares         | N              | Y                   | Nightmares exist to spread darkness. If the worst they do is break lights, that's just vandalism. If they're breaking APCs, they're 100% valid.|
| Nuclear Operatives | Y              | N                   | Includes standard Operatives, Lone Operative and Clown Operatives. Enemy of the Corporation Status|
| Spiders            | Y              | N                   | Depending on populations, a spider infestation can overwhelm a station, hence always valid.|
| Ninja              | Y              | N                   | Enemy of the Corporation: Spider Clan|
| Heretic            | Y, See Notes   | Y, See Notes        | Visibly a Heretic is valid. Ascended Heretic is valid. Escalation with NON TARGETS are required until ascension. No explicit required escalation with a named target for objectives. |
| Malf AI            | N, See Notes   | Y, See Notes        | Delta AI is valid for whole crew to hunt.|
| Bloodsucker        | N              | Y                   | Can be hunted by The Chaplain and The Curator. |
| Revenant           | Y              | N                   | Revenants can be fought by anyone that happens to catch them.|
| Morph              | Y              | N                   | Morphs can either be just a nuisance or an assistant to a round ending threat depending on circumstances.|
| Slasher            | N              | Y                   | Slashers are spooky |
| Traitor/Contractor | N              | Y                   | Traitors that complete final objective are valid. Traitors otherwise aren't validhuntable but can still be dealt with via escalation.|
| Regal Rat          | Y              | Y                   |  |
| Fugitives          | N, See Notes   | Y                   | The Hunters sent to find you do not have to escalate as they are there to do just that. The crew don't have to help them or even you either.|
| Abductors          | Y              | N                   | Can't exactly escalate with or as an alien, now can you?|
| Obsessed           | N              | Y                   | This antagonist requires extra escalation to ensure that it is not just for grief. |
| Paradox Clone      | ???            | ???                 | Probably the strangest entry on the list. The only objective in the code is to murder and replace, but not all will do that, hence the unknown rating|
| Florida Man        | ???            | ???                 | Florida Man does as Florida Man wants. Can be right here at the bottom of the list where it belongs or a higher threat than the Cults and Wizards.|
| Maintenance Clown  | Y              | N                   | If you kill the wrong clown, you're might be in the wrong! |

To discuss the table here, we list off the various antagonists, whether they can be validhunted or not by the *crew*, wether the *antagonist must have some amount of escalation*, and some additional notes. This is just the tip of the iceburg but helps clarify most things for the majority of players. If this is where your need for information ends, congrats. If you need more, read on further.

## Antagonists and Security

As a general rule of thumb, Security (and anyone formally deputized by Security) always have the ability to validhunt an antagonist because it is their job. Any crew that sees security engaged with an antagonist may join forces with or even against security as defending others is a valid reason to step in per Rule 9 of escalation. But the obligation is to defend, not to chase. If Security requests your assistance, then of course you may join them.

Now for some more specific guidance regarding Security's relationship with some types of antagonists:

- **Heretics** are always valid to security, regardless of status.

## Perception is Reality

This is a lesson that is learned by some through life experience and others never truly encounter it. So, to put this down here, *perception is reality*. For example, if you're a traitor that went and bought a nukie mod suit, that blood red nuclear operative suit is usually worn... **by nuclear operatives**. So if you look like a particular antagonist, expect to get treated the way that is most appropriate.

# Specific Stuff for Antagonists
Because of how varied and unique some of the antagonists may be, some additional guidance is provided here so one can make more smart decisions about how they wish to engage with their objectives (if they so choose) or otherwise to raise hell.

## Murderbone Specific Antagonists
Applies to: **Wizards**, **Ninjas**, **Nuclear Operatives**, **Ascended Heretics**, **Spiders**, **Space Dragons**, **Blob**, **Nightmares**, **Xenos**

Everyone hates you. Everyone wants you dead. Nobody has to have a reason to after you as you're openly a threat. Handle things on how you see fit.

**Flesh Spiders**: you are openly hostile to anything that isn't another Flesh Spider. Yes, even the changling that supposedly gave you life.

**Nightmares**: If you want to convince the crew that you're not out to kill them and just simply want the lights off, you can do just that.

## Conversion-based Antagonists
Applies to: **Cultists**, **The Revolution**, **Bloodsuckers**

Conversion antagonists should be more focused on converting those to their cause rather than outright running around killing people left and right. 

**Revolutionaries** have a little bit of leniency on this as their goal is to overthrow the Heads of Staff, which may get non-heads caught in the crossfire.

**Bloodsuckers** sit in a unique position in this category as, depending on your choice of Clan, you are going to want thralls in particular positions. Focusing on those particular positions is a helpful thing to do.

## Traitor-type Antagonists
Applies to: **Traitors**, **Contractors**, **Changlings**, **Non-Ascended Heretics**.

You have escalation requirements to meet if you're killing people. If they attack first, you can obviously defend yourself. That's not a problem.

For purposes of completing contracts, the **Contractors** are not required to escalate with their target for the kidnapping. Anyone else you must still escalate with.

**Non-Ascended Heretics** have a list of five individuals to sacrifice. Those sacrifice targets can be taken without escalation. Anyone else involved must still have escalation.

## Other Antagonists

**Florida Man** does what Florida Man does. What is that? Nobody really knows.

**Paradox Clones** are simply just in the wrong place at the wrong time. We don't know if they are all explicitly wanting to kill who they are... or aren't... yeah, don't try to think about it too hard.

**Ashwalkers**, you get to have some special guidance here on this page. Considering that depending on the events of a given round, you may either be friendly with the station or outright at war with them, you really should be starting at a distrustful level with the station goers. You **must** defend your tendril. If you do not do this, you will face consequences of the dark gods of Lavaland.

**Prisoners** are not antagonists on their own. If you don't have another kind of antagonist, you will require significantly more escalation before you can get violent. Remember: you're lower than scum and the AI can ignore you unless you are actively dying.

**Assistants** are not antagonists on their own. If you don't have a proper valid antagonist status and you do antagonist things, expect to be treated like one per *perception is reality* and be permanently round removed for being an antagonist.

# Maintence, Antagonists and You!

Maintenance should be a spooky and scary place to be in. If you are deep in maintenance tunnels, antagonists can get you a little easier than out in the open of the rest of the station. If you somehow find yourself in a trap and then an antagonist gets you, you'll have firmly walked into their trap!

Antagonists: Feel free to do things like making traps, setting up elaborate schemes in order to *lure* people into maintenance. You can't just simply walk out, knock someone out, drag them in and then kill them. Whoever you wish to antagonize should be established in maintenance of their volition.
