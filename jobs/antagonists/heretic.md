# Heretic

> The big tree isn't here. No, someone else can make that. Also, if there's any sort of stuff about some "moon" path, that's not on the codebase yet. Please enjoy this page for everything else, however.

"Forgotten, devoured, gutted. Humanity has forgotten the eldritch forces of decay, but the mansus veil has weakened. We will make them taste fear again..."

So you're a Heretic? Well, get ready for magic and battle. Grab influences, complete sacrifices, accomplish rituals, and ascend to godhood. 

# The Mansus Veil Weakens

You are a nasty little bookworm in search of truth and power, and you have arrived on a station ripe with opportunities. The ultimate goal of a Heretic is to research knowledge of the Mansus. Every knowledge gained grants you new abilities and unlocks new rituals until you become all powerful.

You can gain knowledge points and become stronger through a few ways:

- Harvesting knowledge by draining pierces in reality located around the station of powerel
- Waiting for new knowledge to be revealed to you over time
- Sacrificing crew members your dark patrons may hunger for.

## Sacrificing

The Mansus desires only a select few Heathens (non-heretics) at any moment.

At the start of the round you will be assigned five sacrifice targets. You can reroll these with an optional knowledge later on, but until then, you're stuck with those.

- One target will be a Head of Staff. Heads of staff are worth an additional point!
- One target will be a member of security.
- One target will be a member of your department.
- Two targets will be completely random crewmembers.

You will only be able to sacrifice these targets. Your patrons will not accept just any old assistant.

Follow your Living Heart to your target of choice and incapacitate them through any means necessary. If your target's in critical or dead, they're ready to sacrifice. Drag them over a transmutation rune and invoke the rune to sacrifice them.

Whenever a target is sacrificed, they're healed up and sent to a Shadow Realm, forced to dodge the Hands of the Mansus to fight for their survival. They will then be sent back to the station and **lose all memory** of whoever sacrificed them, so your ass is covered on that front.

However, if you mess up the target something fierce and they're unable to be revived, they'll make a huge mess over your rune. Keep your sacrifices in good condition, or leave behind a large amount of evidence that you're on the hunt! 

## Eldritch Influences

Influences are the easy way to gain power points. Whenever there are Heretics aboard Space Station 13, influences will randomly spawn across the station. In this state, influences are only visible to Heretics. These are untapped and ripe for the picking. RMB on an influence with an empty hand to harvest it.

After being harvested, the influence vanish temporally. Soon after, it will reappear and change its appearance, becoming a pierced reality. More importantly, it will become visible to the entire crew. Influences can only be harvested once, so don't waste time trying to collect those that other Heretics have already taken! 

Using a Codex Cicatrix to harvest an influence will reward double the knowledge points. Risk for reward!

## Heretical Research

Once you have some power points, it's time to research! Open up your Antag Info UI (Action button, top left) and visit the second tab. The research menu forms a branching tree (see below), and your first selection will be to commit to a path that defines your initial abilities and Final Ascension. You can earn abilities from other paths to a limited degree, but overall your chosen path will heavily influence your play-style.

## Transmutation is the Key

Eventually, you'll need to start using proper magics. To draw a transmutation rune, you'll need a writing tool, such as a pen or crayon. Activate Mansus Grasp in your offhand and click on the floor to begin drawing a rune. These runes are green and take up a 3x3 area, and while they can go under other objects, it's best to keep them clear for transmutation purposes.

You can remove runes by using your Mansus Grasp on it, and you can also freely use other Heretics' runes.

To transmute, simply click the rune with an empty hand while the appropriate object(s) are on top of it, making sure that nothing else is in the way. Transmutation Rituals allow you to create powerful artifacts, demonic monsters, and many useful tools that will help you progress towards ultimate power.

The Codex Cicatrix can also draw and remove runes, and does it as a faster rate than doing it by hand.

## Focus is Necessary

To cast more advanced spells, you must focus by wearing an Amber Focus or holding an open Codex Cicatrix. You may transmute other items into them with your Starting Knowledge.

Some more powerful heretical equipment also functions as a focus - Namely, the Ominous Armor from the Armorer's Ritual (when the hood is flipped up) and the Warm Eldritch Medallion from the Ashen Eyes ritual. Ascending also disabled the need for a focus. 

## The Heretic Blade

The Sickly Blade will be your first unlocked research. It can be created by transmuting a common knife with a secondary ingredient based on your path, and serves as a powerful melee weapon as well as a one time use escape tool.

All paths have their own kind of blade, which only differ in appearance and name without any additional research. As with the Mansus Grasp, your blade will be upgraded by your research over time. Said upgrades will differ depending on the path you choose.

You are limited in the amounts of blades you can create at a time - Ash, Void, and Rust limit you to two blades, and Flesh limits you to three. Try not to lose them!

Additionally, you can break your blade by activating it in-hand to teleport to a random, (mostly) safe location in a pinch. Better to lose your weapon and live another day than die fighting.

## Objectives

All Heretics spawn with the same objectives.

- Research Heretic knowledge. You start with 6.
- Sacrifice multiple people.

Some Heretic paths will also gain additional objectives.

- Summon a number of monsters. (This only counts Heretic monsters, NOT ghouls!)

To purchase your Ascension, you must complete all of your objectives!

# Paths of Decay

There are different aspects of the arcane to which you can devote yourself. While most all rituals and spells can be learned by a single Heretic, your first and most important choice will decide how your Blade and Grasp will evolve, and how your final ascension will transform you. 

| Path  | Name  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| Path of Ash  | Nightwatcher's Secret  | The Path of Ash revolves around fire, mobility, and crowd control.  It grants multiple tools that are very forgiving for a new Heretic,  including a short range jaunt that works while handcuffed and a mask  that slowly saps nearby Heathens of sanity and soul, and is highly  recommended for first-timers. While its abilities may not be the  strongest until later in the round, they are very easy to get the ball  rolling with and difficult to stop. Ascending gives you the power to  burn down the station in a living tornado of flame.  |
| Path of Lock  | A Steward's Secret  | The Path of Lock grants you incredible area control as well as  enough tools to bamboozle those who attempt to reach you. Your weaponry  is mainly focused on utility, rather than offense or even defense,  despite being able to branch into harmful sidepaths. Lock Heretics are  able to quickly disappear and trick chasers with their Eldritch Card, as  well as quickly return to safe points across the station. Ascending  allows you to turn into empowered eldritch creatures and will open a  portal into the Labyrinth's Heart at the side of the ritual, summoning  an endless army of eldritch horrors at your service.  |
| Path of Flesh  | Principle of Hunger  | The Path of Flesh focuses on summoning player-controlled minions and  demons to do your bidding. Heretics on this path gain almost no  offensive or defensive abilities, and rely heavily on stockpiling  corpses and organs to complete rituals. Despite this, it offers many fun  and powerful tools to those who can make it to the end, making it a  difficult (but satisfying) path overall for inexperienced Heretics.  Ascending allows you to shed your human form and become something much greater.  |
| Path of Void  | Glimmer of Winter  | The Path of Void focuses on stealth, silence and the freezing cold.  While the path offers very little utility early on, they quickly gain  the ability to silence and freeze their victims, opening the window to  silently ambush targets with no other items or chemicals required. It  also offers full immunity to freezing temperatures, an invisible armored  cloak (with pockets!), and later a targeted blink that damages anything  nearby. The path has access to many strong transmuted items, but  requires smart use to realize their full potential, making it moderately  difficult but a good beginner choice. Ascending silences those around  you and makes you the eye of a deadly blizzard.  |
| Path of the Blade  | The Cutting Edge  | The Path of the Blade empowers you to become master of one-on-one  combatant. The path lacks many spells or utility, especially early on,  but as you grow in power, your blades gain the ability to counter attack  and even dual wield. Blade Heretics can summon orbiting knives that  will protect them entirely from any attacks, including stun batons.  Additionally, Blade Heretics have a few tools to make getting the jump  on your victims easier. Ascending grants you a whirlwind of knives to  protect you from all kinds of attacks, as well as greatly enhancing your  abilities in combat, especially with your curved blades.  |
| Path of Rust  | Blacksmith's Tale  | The Path of Rust is about healing, corruption, and brute forcing  through all obstacles, at the cost of stealth. Rust grants you the  ability to destroy silicons and mechs in one strike, fry any  electronics, and demolish any walls or doors. Most of your abilities  will create rust - standing over rust grants you healing and resilience.  While you will become immensely resistant standing on rusted tiles, you  have very little in the way of tools otherwise, making it a moderately  difficult path to take. Ascending grants you unparalleled healing and  survivability when standing over rust and spreads a tide of rust over  the station from your rune.  |
| Path of Cosmos  | Eternal Gate  | The Path of Cosmos allows you to control the area by using cosmic  carpets. Cosmic carpets cannot be entered by people with a star mark.  The Cosmic Heretic has several spells throughout the path that give  people star marks and generate cosmic carpets. The path only contains  spells so an amber focus will be useful. This path is complex and  requires knowledge of how the path works to realize its full potential.  Ascending summons a controllable entity, albeit can require a lot of  attention to function optimally.  |

# Abilities

Below is a table with all your abilities. Upon choosing a path, you begin at the top of the tree, moving straight downwards; the first few abilities you unlock are thus based on your path. However, some abilities are located between paths, and can be unlocked by moving sideways once you're adjacent to them. With enough points, you can theoretically unlock all of these 'neutral' abilities, as well as dipping into other paths' abilities, but you can only ever unlock **one Mark** and **one Blade/Steel** ability, and you can only unlock **the ascension that matches your starting path**.

In the below tree, dark colored abilities can only be obtained by starting on the corresponding path, green abilities are "neutral" abilities that you can use to cross paths, and light colored abilities can be earned by any path by first going through the neutral ones.

Keep in mind that the mark ability, blade/steel ability, and your final ascension all cost 2 points each. 

## Starting Knowledge

| Name  | Description  |
|---|---|
| Break of Dawn  | Grants you the Mansus Grasp, a powerful and upgradable disabling  spell that can be cast without a focus. It will cause temporary garbled  speech, as well as knock your victim down and deal 80 stamina damage.  This does not work on those with anti-magic.  |
| The Living Heart  | Grants you the Living Heart, transforming your heart into a Living  Heart, which allows you to track your sacrifice targets. Beware that  using this ability will pulse an audible heartbeat. If you lose your  Living Heart, you can transmute a new one with a poppy and a pool of  blood while standing on a rune. If your heart is cybernetic, you will  additionally need to supply an organic heart in the ritual. If your species doesn't have a heart, one of your other organs will be used instead - check your research tab in-game to see which.  |
| Heartbeat of the Mansus  | Allows you to sacrifice targets who are in critical or worse  condition to the Mansus, sending them to the Shadow Realm and rewarding  you with two knowledge points; or three if your victim was a head of  staff. If you have no targets, you can stand on a rune and invoke it to  acquire some.  |
| Amber Focus  | Allows you to transmute a sheet of glass and a pair of eyes into an  Amber Focus. This is a small neck-worn item that allows you to cast more  advanced Heretic spells while worn.  |
| Codex Cicatrix  | Allows you to transmute a book, any unique pen, and hide/leather  from any animal (humans included) to create a Codex Cicatrix. Draining  influences with the Codex rewards double the points, drawing runes with  it scribes three times as fast, and it can be used to remove runes with  ease. Opening the Codex allows you to focus for your advanced Heretic  spells.  |
| Cloak of Shadow  | Grants you the spell Cloak of Shadow, which will conceal your  identity in an obvious purple smoke, making you move faster but interact  slower. Requires a focus to cast.  |

## The Heretic Path Chart

\[inordinanately fucking hell way that tg made the ability trees laid out. and it has a path that doesnt exist in our codebase. someone else can make this tree and probably post an image of it that makes sense.]

## Optional Knowledge

There are also a few optional, dead end knowledges you can research to help improve your ability to progress towards ascension.

| Name  | Requirement  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| The Relentless Heartbeat  | Mask of Madness, Raw Prophet, Void Phase, Stance of the Torn Champion, Aggressive Spread, Star Blast, or Burglar's Finesse  | Allows you to transmute a harebell, a book, and any jumpsuit while  standing on a rune to reroll your sacrifice targets. This grants you  five new sacrifice targets (not guaranteed to be different from your old  ones, though). This will never give you targets that you've already  sacrificed before or dead targets.  |
| Lionhunter Rifle Ammunition  | Lionhunter's Rifle  | Allows you to transmute hide from any animal with three ballistic  ammunition casings, such as shotgun shots (used or unused) to create  another clip of ammunition - three rounds - for the Lionhunter Rifle.  |

## Carvings

Carvings are special runes that can be etched into the floor using the Carving Knife, an item gained from researching the Tier 2 Void-Blade side path. These carvings act as traps that trigger when a victim steps onto one. You can have up to a maximum of 3 carvings placed at any time, and having carvings placed grants you an ability to destroy all carvings should you ever need to replace them. 

| Name  | Description  |
|---|---|
| Alert Carving  | Gives you a message every time someone walks over it with their name  and area. This carving has a very low alpha value in-game, making it  very hard to see. It is not destroyed when someone walks over it.  |
| Grasping Carving  | When walked over, the victim is stunned for five seconds and their legs receive heavy damage.  |
| Maddening Carving  | When walked over, applies dizzyness, jiterryness, temporary  blindness, confusion , stuttering, slurring and a large amount of  stamina damage to the victim.  |

## Crucible Potions

Crucible Potions (or brews) are unique consumable items that are created from a Mawed Crucible, a structure gained from researching the Tier 2 Blade-Rust sidepath. Each kind of potion grants a special buff to you once used. A crucible can make up to 5 individual potions before needing to be refilled with body parts or organs. 

| Name  | Description  |
|---|---|
| Brew of Crucible Soul  | Allows you to phase through walls for 15 seconds. After the time runs out, you get teleported to your original location.  |
| Brew of Dusk and Dawn  | Allows you to see clearly through walls and objects for 60 seconds.  |
| Brew of Wounded Soldier  | For the next 60 seconds, each wound you have will heal you: Minor  wounds heal 1 of it's damage type per second, moderate heal 3 and  critical heal 6. Non-burn wounds will also restore lost blood.  Additionally, you will no longer be slowed down from damage.  |


# Tips

- Unlike most other solo antagonists, Heretics start weak but grow stronger over time. It would be best not to attract too much attention to yourself until you unlock more powerful spells and equipment.
-  Many unlockable transmutations require body parts or whole corpses. You can get these from your victims, as well as by raiding the Morgue, or with the correct access, turning monkeys into catatonic humans.
- Even if you never fight other heretics, you're inherently at odds with them. Each influence can only be harvested once, so the heretic that goes the fastest and grabs the most influences first has to do less killing and sacrificing to reach their ascensions.
- Your Mansus Grasp will temporarily garble the speech of people who you use it on. This can let you get away with murder while comms are online, but be careful - it's not foolproof!
- Influences can spawn in almost any location on the station, ranging from the main hallways and public restrooms to Command staff offices and restricted security areas in the Brig. It's best to check every area you can access, public and department.
- If you can't find any influences by peaking in windows, try getting to a Security Camera Console either breaking into a security post or by building your own. Simply cycle through the cameras and make note of any influences you see. Do watch your back while doing this, you don't want to be busted by an officer while you're distracted!
- As a Heretic, access is more important than ever! The more areas you can easily access, the more influences you'll be able to snag. Getting all access can be a godsend, and knowing how to either hack or talk your way into other departments can help you beat other Heretics to the free points.
- A Paramedic ID is very valuable, as it gives at least basic access to a wide variety of airlocks across the station. Having one of these (either by being a paramedic yourself or stealing it from a coworker) makes it that much easier to reach influences.
- Drawing new runes requires you to stand still for a very long time. Draw your runes beforehand to avoid having to hold on to a body for much longer, and to leave quicker. You might not have time to draw a rune if Security is hot on your tail.
- The Mawed Crucible can be wrenched/unwrenched by using your Codex or your Mansus Grasp on it, allowing you to relocate if necessary.
- You can create two blades as most Heretics, or three as flesh / five as blade. Carry an extra in your bag to break in case you need to escape from a sticky situation. You can also carry blades on your Eldritch Armor and Void Cloak!
- The Carving Knife, while useful for making defensive traps, is also a robust throwing weapon with high embed chance. Make a few of them for a good ranged weapon!
- Having Aristocrat's Way researched allows you to spacewalk with only a firefighting suit and helmet, as they are pressure resistant. Useful if your job doesn't have access to actual spacesuits/hardsuits.
- Entropic Plume causes any living mob caught in the plume to randomly strike other nearby mobs, which includes Beepsky and other Securitrons. Use sec's robot pets against them!
- Even after ascension, you aren't completely invincible. Don't get too hasty and end up eating a barrage of deadly lasers to the face.
- Pierced Realities cause harm to Heathens depending on how you interact with them. Examining them as a Heathen deals 10 brain damage. Interacting with them as a Heathen has a 1/4 chance of your arm being eaten up by it. Interacting with them as a Heathens using telekinesis will cause your head to literally explode in a very flashy manner.
- When starting out, you may want to rely on certain makeshift weapons. You can craft flashlight eyes for use in certain rituals, and create shivs by wrapping cloth (cut up bedsheets) around a shard of glass to transmute your blade.
- Live or die, victims you send to the shadow realm will never remember that you did it. This means that for avoiding detection, the most important thing is to make sure nobody else knows about you.
- Your Ritual of Knowledge is a great way to get a ton of points without drawing too much attention (probably.) Completing it as soon as possible is a good way to get a lot of power fast.
- By default, nothing on you is incriminating. If security suspects you, but can't actually pin anything heretical on you, you might be able to pass off as a Traitor instead.
- Monkeys, and monkey-humans (created by giving a monkey mutadone) make for great, usually non-suspicious sources of organs or corpses for your heretical rituals.
- Security about to check out your ritual hideout? Remember your grasp can instantly destroy a circle, leaving no evidence behind you were up to no good. But be careful - It'll go on cooldown after, and people may hear the cast sound.
- Remember that other players can hear your Living Heart, too. Don't use it in public unless people are distracted.
- Ashen Shift and Void Phase make for incredibly powerful escape tools. If you have either of these, it might be wise to have an Amber Focus somewhere on you at all times for emergencies.
- Fear the syringe gun. Mute Toxin will single-handedly shut down your ability to cast your spells.
- Summoning rituals can be incredibly powerful if you get a good player on your side.
- Most summoned monsters will drop the components used to create them on death. While having them to die is not ideal, you can easily grab the parts and summon another.
- Shattered Risen ghouls are strong enough to bash open locked lockers and airlocks.
- Furious Steel will allow you to melee attack while it's active. Use it for a leg up in close quarters combat!
