# Underpaid Grunts

As an Intern, you're at the bottom of Command, last to be asked and last to be paid.

Your job is dirty and unrespected, you must run into whatever CentCom sends you if they're too greedy to spend their resources on ERT. As such you must be ready to face anything and make out of it alive, remember that your soul belongs to the NT, you cannot escape your student debt!

### Equipment

As an Intern you actually get some kind of equipment, those are:

- The Police Baton is not as fancy as the Stun Baton but still does the job of subduing people.
- Sunglasses, protect your eyes from flashes and flashbangs that the station is full of.
- Mosin Nagant rifle is an extremely ancient but very robust bolt-action rifle.
- 2 strips of 7.62mm, used in Mosin Nagant rifle.

CentCom usually won't give you anything else (be thankful they gave you that, sometimes you may be deployed without anything) so you better keep your equipment close, remember that if you lose any it will be deducted from your pay! 

# The Least Poor among Poor

You're most likely will be sent as a horde, and horde has an Intern Head. He has slightly more equipment and authority over other Interns.

You must make sure that Interns will do the task you all were given if you will be able to control the horde.

### Equipment

- Stun Baton, is better than Police Baton but you must recharge it sadly.
- Armor Vest, better protection than just your green T-shirt, also gives you the ability to carry your rifle without ditching the satchel.
- Megaphone, used to project your voice loudly so you can control those hungry Interns
- Intern Cap, to showcase your "authority" over others
