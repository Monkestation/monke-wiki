Well, looks like there's another divergence into some absolutely terrifying timeline, and future Nanotrasen has sent you to fix it! 

# Preface

Originally designed to replace the Space Ninja, the Chrono Legionnaires have stalled due to balance issues. As a result, they are admin-only, much like Highlanders, simply because the whole teleport --> insta-stun --> delayed-deletion wasn't really that well received. 

# Goals

As Chrono Legionnaires are admin-only, their goals fluctuate wildly based on what future Nanotrasen want them to do. 90% of the time, this means erasing the shit out of someone from history that shouldn't be there or are a major threat to the timeline (mainly players who name themselves after some particular historical figures).

Your standard objective will usually look something like this:

Using your TED device, erase Adolf Hitler, the Captain, from the timestream. 

# Your MODsuit

As a Chrono Legionnaire, your only equipment is your MODsuit, but it comes equipped with a variety of modules useful for different situations. 

## Chrono MODSuit

Used for: Teleporting around like a badass.
Strategy: Equip it, use its modules. 

An advanced MODsuit equipped with different time- and gravity-manipulating modules, as well as an infinite power cell. Is completely fireproof and acidproof and offers robust protection from all damage types (60 melee, 60 bullet, 60 laser, 60 energy, 30 bomb, 100 bio, 100 fire, 100 acid, 15 wounding). Has no storage module by default. Spaceproof and has no slowdown. 

## MOD Eradication Lock Module

Used for: Preventing people from using your MODsuit.
Strategy: Use this module as soon as you spawn. This binds it to your CKEY (BYOND name) and erases non-owners when they try activating the modsuit. 

A module which remembers the original owner of the suit, even alternate universe versions. When a non-owner enters, the eradication lock will begin eradicating the suit from the timeline... with the intruder inside. Not the way you want to go, so it turns out to be a good deterrent.

## MOD Timeline Jumper Module

Used for: Teleporting basically anywhere, escaping.
Strategy: Use this module when you need to escape from someone or get to somewhere 

A module used to traverse timelines, phasing the user in and out of the stream of events. Lets you enter a jaunt that resets all immobility effects and stamina damage and lets you unjaunt whenever and wherever you want. Has a cooldown of 5 seconds after jaunting/unjaunting. 

## MOD Rewinder Module

Used for: Teleporting back to where you were 10 seconds ago.
Strategy: You can use this module as an alternative way of escaping a chase, but your Timeline Jumper Module is probably better for this. 

Sets an anchor point on activation and prevents you from using any other modules for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds teleports you back to the anchor point. Has a cooldown of 20 seconds.

## MOD Timestopper Module

Used for: Stopping time in a small area around you for as long as you want.
Strategy: A good tool for dealing with crowds of people, use it when surrounded to stop time around you. 

Stops time in a small area around you for as long as you want. Moving ends the timestop. Great for monologues. Has a cooldown of 60 seconds.

## MOD Timestream Eradication Module

Used for: Erasing someone from the timeline.
Strategy: Use this on lone targets. 

Starts erasing someone from the timeline when used for them. They can't do anything when they're being erased, but you have to stand still or the erasure process will start reversing. Only works on one target at a time, trying to use it on someone else unlinks the previous target. 

## MOD Kinesis+ Module

Used for: Moving and throwing objects and creatures from a distance.
Strategy: Use on objects or people when you want to move or throw them. 

A newer version of the MOD kinesis module, it can not only manipulate different objects, but also living creatures. People grabbed this way can resist by moving after an initial burst of inertia.

# Tips

- Remember that your Chrono MODsuit is not only a great suit of armor but space proof as well! Don't feel bad if you need to slip into space for a moment if when overwhelmed.
- If you only have a single target, your mission will most likely be short and simple. Just wait for a moment when your target will most likely be alone and won't have may visitors.
- On occasion future Nanotrasen may deem that the entire crew of the station is a threat and needs every last person erased. In the event this happens you will probably be working together with a squad of Legionnaires. Work together to pick everybody off one by one!
- If you are tasked with erasing the entire crew, fuck up the Virologist and Xenobiologist. They almost always work alone, and you shouldn't have any issues with dispatching them with extreme prejudice.
- Roleplay as the space Viet Cong, teleporting out of the shadows to pick out loner targets. Don't be afraid to break away if sec arrives, giving up a small minnow is worth reeling in a gigantic carp.
- When the remaining crew have congregated into groups (assuming you've decided to kill everyone you can), you can use guns of already killed people, as your timeline jumper module allows you to keep items in hands. You can also wait until they split and erase them one-by-one.
- You have an EMP Shield module installed in your MODsuit, as well as an infinite power cell, so EMPs are not a problem to you.
- Your MODsuit doesn't have a storage module installed by default, so if you want to use other items you'll have to store them in your pockets or hold them in your hands. Luckily your suit's modules are usually all you need to deal with anything.
- Your modsuit doesn't have flash or sound protection, getting sunglasses and a bowman headset as soon as possible is advised.
- Even though your suit is fully fireproof, you can still overheat from being on fire and start taking damage, so try to extinguish yourself as soon as you can if you're set on fire.
- Your Timeline Jumper Module resets all immobility effects and stamina damage on use, so you can escape basically anything, even if you were stunned.
