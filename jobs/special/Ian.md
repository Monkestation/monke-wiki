# Things Ian can do! (maybe)

Ian can now be given commands! To make Ian your best friend just pet him a lot, in the future to will be changed to feeding and playing but for now just petting. After a set amount of petting you can give Ian various commands, commands include:

- Fetch: Ian fetches an object after the player gives this command and points to a object
- Sic: Ian will attack whatever you pointed to to attack, though having a Welsh Corgi sicced on you isn't as bad as some would think, the little bugger can do some damage!
- Heel: Ian will stay in place on your command, good for restricting movement in a bad situation.
