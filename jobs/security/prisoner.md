# Prisoner

| \[ job_image ]<br>job title | Access: None<br>Additional Access: N/A<br>Difficulty: Easy<br>Supervisors: ~~You are above the law~~ Warden<br>Duties: ~~Break windows to space and hide in cargo for the rest of the round, defending your freedom.~~ Do whatever you can in permabrig.<br>Guides: This is it<br>Alternate Titles: Minimum/Maximum/SuperMax Security Prisoner, Protective Custody Prisoner, Convict, Felon, Inmate|

Important: Just because you are in perma DOES NOT mean you are an antagonist. You are still bound by rule 1 and rule 6.

For some god forsaken reason, in a Space Station literally filled to the brim with opportunities, you've chosen to be the single job which has a severely constrained pool of options. Well, good for you! In fact, the Prisoner is one of the few roles which can actually work as intended for both new players and veterans, whilst still providing options for conflict.

All prisoners spawn in with the following policy text, which should govern their interactions through the shift (or face administrative action):

- You are not an antagonist. Remember: you did sign up for this role. If you should want to walk the halls of the station once more, you should earn your freedom, whether by escaping your confines or working with security/lawyers to determine terms of release. You might prove to be valuable manpower against the various threats the station professes.
- If you should wish to escape, minimize harm while preserving your own life, and understand that you may not enjoy the consequences of your actions if you get caught once more.
    Otherwise, enjoy the amenities of the wing that holds you.

Bare minimum requirements: Have enough common sense and basic morality in your head to not wordlessly stab the Warden to death with spears when they come to deposit a prisoner.
Basic skills: Roleplay a bit, make up a backstory, converse with your fellow prisoner.
Advanced skills: Spark up a bit of action and conflict while you're at it! Keep Security on their toes. 

# Welcome to the Permabrig

This will probably be your home for most of the shift. You spawn in here with one other prisoner, without any backstory. There is a bareboned garden, a basketball hoop, a small laundromat, and some sanitary facilities. There is some food, along with a Microwave, but don't expect Nanotrasen to provide much for you. After all, you ARE a criminal. Besides that, there's an arcade machine, two decks of cards, and a bag of dice to keep yourself somewhat entertained. Within this picture, there are all the materials for crafting a Spear and conducting a jailbreak without dying. But, I ain't telling you.

Ideally, since you are the single job without any duties or obligations, you should be making a backstory for yourself to keep yourself sane. If you're one of the poor saps who spawn in without a cellmate, well, no luck in having much fun. 

# Things to Do

- Play cards.
- Watch as the AI hopelessly screeches at you through the Holopad.
- Grow plants.
- Dye your clothes so that you look like a hippie.
- Draw shitty drawings.
- I haven't gotten around to adding more, too busy escaping into Cargo.
- Build up massive amounts of biomass in the Biogenerator to flood the place with monkeys and make it uninhabitable so the Warden will let you out.
