Welcome to Security. Chances are that you have been assigned this job because it was the only available position other than Assistant. Since you'd rather not end up a corpse, or doubt the prospects of reassignment, you've chosen the Few, the Red, and the Despised.

Important: DO NOT play Security if you are new to Space Station 13! You will become a liability and everyone will have a bad time.

Bare minimum requirements: Do not turn into Shitcurity.

# The Peacekeeper

You are the sole guardian between the ideals of justice and the wild psychotics that your company has chosen to advance its interests in space. Just because everyone else is insane, however, does not mean you are permitted to go hog-wild and beat them all unconscious to strap them to beds. Professionals have standards.

# How to Do Your Job

TL; DR:

- Learn your surroundings.
- Equip yourself appropriately.
- Learn what to do when an emergency is called out and you're needed.
- Go patrolling and keep your eyes and ears open.
- Refer any evidence to the Detective for forensic scanning.
- Detain any criminals you may come across in the act!
- Don't become [shitcurity](https://wiki.monkestation.com/en/jobs/security/guide-to-shitcurity). Seriously. Everyone will hate you if you do.
- ~~Crush your enemies. See them driven before you.~~

# Know Your Place

Well, this page is designed to turn you from angry, bitter waste of supplies into a useful and productive member of the station community. A few things to immediately note:

- This ship is not a democracy. You take from the Warden, who takes his orders from the Head of Security, who takes his orders from the Captain, who takes his orders from CentCom. This is a military Chain of Command.
- Likewise, the Heads of Staff have authority over their respective departments. You are expected to assist heads in ejecting unwanted trespassers and demoting unwanted personnel from their departments.
- You are effectively the police. The corporations have agreed upon a set of laws that they are all beholden to. An example of these laws can be found at Space Law. Obey the hierarchy and watch everyone with utter suspicion.
- Your essential job function is to keep the crew safe. You will inevitably fail at this task, more or less. Like a breeding salmon, keep swimming against the rapids, bears be damned.
- Even though the station is doomed, do your best to keep the peace on station and you'll be the best officer there can be.
- The space law is a set of guidelines, meaning you do not have to follow it. You'll be considered a better officer once you understand which crimes cause legit grief (such as sabotaging a workplace) and which don't.

# Assignments

Each officer is given an assignment when they join the game. Most will be assigned to guard a department. Department guards are given a small security office along with limited access and are able to use that department's radio channel. Department guards are also marked with color-coded armbands. While they are not required to remain at their post, it is their responsibility to protect it.

Like general Security Officers, department guards report directly to the Head of Security. However, they should generally follow the wishes of the head of the department they are guarding. Guards may be dismissed from their post by the department head.

# Security Offices

The first step after you arrive is to find an unused security locker in the brig's equipment room. If it has all been claimed, ask the Warden for additional resources.

### Security Equipment
\[ discussion and links to equipment. man i hate the tg wiki sometimes ]

### Remember to Recharge!
Always have your tools recharged after an arrest. If your flash is burnt out, get a new one from the lockers or security vending machine and hand your old one to a roboticist. Then take your baton or disabler, pop them in the charger station in your security office or the Head of Personnel's desk, and wait for the light to change from green to yellow. Having a charged stun baton is sometimes the difference between life and death. 

# Officer Beepsky: Redshirt's Best Friend

All stations start with one Securiton, some with three: Officer Beepsky who patrols the halls, Sergeant-at-Armsky who guards the armory (weapon and ID check on, arrest level DETAIN), as well as Officer Pingsky who guards the AI satellite and reports arrests on the AI Private radio channel.

More can be built, ~~as well as ED-209s who carry disablers~~ ED-209s are disabled however.

# Donuts

Any good Security Officer always has some of these around at all times. They are delightful little munchables that can be obtained in a few ways. You can find an immediate supply in the donut boxes around the station, and you can use your Hacking skills to extract them from the security vending machines. If there is a severe shortage of donuts, you can always get the Chef to make you more. There are four types of donuts.

**Plain Donut**: Heals you, gives some nutrition.

**Frosted Donut**: Like the plain donut, but heals more health.

**Jelly Donut**: Holy Jesus! What is that? **What the fuck is that?** WHAT IS THAT, PRIVATE PYLE? Only obtainable through the Chef. Heals more than the Frosted Donut, gives more nutrition.

**Chaos Donut**: Only obtainable through the Chef. Kills you, due to a great deal of entropy caused by eating it. 

# Tips

- Hold handcuffs and click on a pair of orange shoes (standard prisoner issue). Result: Leg cuffs!
- The riot gear gives you excellent protection against melee attacks at the cost of defense from bullets and lasers. The ablative armor is the same, except for lasers. The bulletproof armor is the same as the other two, but protects against bullets.
- If you're wearing a secHUD and examine someone, you can change their wanted status by clicking on it in the description. If you're really cool you can even add why they're wanted by clicking the add crime link.
- If you're out of secHUD sunglasses, you can craft them with a secHUD and a regular pair of sunglasses.
- You can move rechargers by wrenching them and dragging them behind you and wrenching them back down to work again.
- Mindshield implants prevent someone from being converted to a revolutionary and deconvert existing revolutionaries. They also prevent someone from being brought into a cult but do not decult those tainted by the Dark Lord's power.
- As a Security Officer, when you see someone set to arrest, kindly ask them to follow you to the brig first. You'd be surprised how often people cooperate even when they are criminals, and it saves you the hassle of SHITCURITY and HELP ME. You can always stun them if they refuse.
- You can retrieve the MMI from a beaten-to-death cyborg by welderbombing it, if you want it to fess up to who the potato is that subverted him and you don't have access to the robotics console.
- Armor is a lifesaver, even the base officer armor.
- Examining shell casing tells you what kind of ammo it is. .38? Detective. .357? Traitor. .45? Nuke ops. ADDED: .357 and 12mm could also point to a wizard round. .38 for that matter, too.
- Once you have a combat mech, the only two things that can stop you is high level antags (wiz / nuke ops / ninja), toxins, and Ion Rifles (R&D can make them and there is one in the Armory). Deal with all of these, and youâ€™re a god among men. And yes, a hulk is shit against a Gygax spamming ac 2 SMG fire as well as punching him at close range. And no, xenos are shit against a Gygax due to the KO punch then ac 2 SMG fire.
- In addition, Riot Shields completely protect against Xenomorph jump attacks and can block their disarms. If you are fighting xenos ask the Warden for a Riot Shield.
- EMP'ed stun batons only lose 10% charge, can be a life saver (not that you get EMP'ed often).
- While using the security cameras console you can take a regular camera in your hand and take a picture of the image you are viewing through the console. You can finally get a picture of a suspect for your wanted papers.
- Mesons can detect bombs.
- Unrobust? No dignity? Security? Call Officer Beepsky to you, disable his patrol mode, then drag him around everywhere. Shift+click anyone who fucks with you and set them to arrest and Beepsky will ensure you never get robusted again.
- Security Camera consoles can track borgs.
- You can set Officer Beepsky to arrest people (except heads and security staff) who are holding weapons.
- PRO SECURITY SEARCH TIP: Always check the Janitor's trash bag and the Chaplainâ€™s bible. Don't forget that boots can hide contraband as well.
- Disablers are nice to have as a sidearm, or if you want to pass out guns.
- Remember the 21 Foot Rule (roughly 6.4 tiles in game assuming 1 tile = 1 meter). Real life cops follow this rule as a knife wielding perp can cover 21 feet in about 1.5 seconds, enough time for you to un-holster your gun, fire off a round or two, and move out of the perp's way.
- Learn how to breach and clear,when your about to enter a room, and you don't know what's going on in there, open the airlock, prime a flashbang, then toss it in. Best to cook the flashbang for a second in order to maximize its potential.
- Combat gloves does not mean Syndicate agent, nor do Syndicate tools. Space explorers can easily get these tools with the right know-how - don't assume treason for having the gloves. However, if more than 4 people are caught wearing different pairs of gloves then there has been Syndicate involvement.
- The greatest weapon you have as a security officer is your own wits and common sense, don't let the power of being an officer go to your head. Act smart, be pragmatic when you need to, know when to relax and when to be on guard, and always be ready to call for backup.
