The Warden is a member of the security staff, responsible for the Brig, the Prison Wing and the management of the prisoners. He essentially acts as a right-hand man to the Head of Security and runs most of the operations within the Brig in the absence of the HoS. The Warden is also tasked with guarding his most valued treasure: The Armory, filled with Security's best gear and armaments.

Bare minimum requirements: Make sure no one who shouldn't is in the armory. Set a timer for arrested people and make sure they don't break out.

# Watch Hound

Half of your job is to look after the prisoners, make sure they don't die or get unfair sentences, and make sure they don't escape. The other half of your job is to arm security with weapons in times of war. You are not a Security Officer and do not have to go outside of the brig (and really should not go out of the brig). Stay in the brig.

Once more: *STAY IN THE GODDAMN BRIG*

Even more important: **WATCH THE DAMN ARMORY**.

# Mister Dispatcher

If you have no prisoners to watch out for, you should be coordinating the Security Officers over the security radio channel. People often make accusations of crime on the radio that you can follow up on. You can ensure all arrest records are filled in on your security records console with information from the security radio channel to make sure officers don't wonder why a particular person is wanted. You can also check on the cameras for reported disturbances and update the records of anyone involved (which should be done regularly). Your fellow officers will appreciate your help in sending them where they can make a difference. You really have the opportunity to make Security run like a well-oiled machine. Frequently check security officers positions and health on your crew monitoring console so you know if they're dead and where they are. 

# Second in Command

As the Warden, you have authority over the brig and any security officers inside the Brig. Should anything happen to the Head of Security, you are expected to take up his position and command the security staff.

### The Detective

Just give the detective space, he's the loose cannon that runs around and scans for prints. In the rare cases where they do drag someone in, they'll need help with the Brig timers and securing evidence. Since almost anyone (even lawyers) with brig access has access to evidence storage, the more dangerous evidence should go in the appropriate locker in the armory.

### Security Officers

Nominally, officers aren't under your command and are not required to follow your orders. That being said, if they're in the brig and mucking around, you are well within your duties to order them to leave. Otherwise, try to be the benevolent eye in the sky and keep tabs on the whereabouts of your team.

### Lawyers

When used correctly, the station's legal counselors can provide an extra layer of security by keeping an eye on things or by policing the various debris and detritus that crops up over the course of a shift. Pass out some spare sunglasses or a SecHUD (if you're feeling particularly generous) and don't refuse their clients' right to counsel. If you wind with a criminal attorney on your hands, don't hesitate to bring the hammer down. 

# Equipment

Given the ever-present threat of prison breaks and riots, a skilled Warden is a well-equipped warden. Your locker contains your personal gear: a brig door remote, a box of flashbangs some extra zip ties and burn resistant gloves that teach you the Krav Maga martial art (detailed in the tips section). Stuff some of that in your bag. Also, consider grabbing a laser weapon: being next to the armory is no use if somebody has blown up the APC and you can't get through the now de-powered windoors to stop them cleaning the place out.

Not only that, but your Armory contains a plethora of gear that can help you in your quest to defend the Brig. Barricades are excellent if someone has broken the Brig doors. Portable flashers are very useful at stopping poorly equipped attackers or budding escapees... along with any moth officers.. You also have a toolbox to help you install the flashers and make other basic adjustments. Make sure no one gets your ID, and that you know who the Head of Security is (in the very real case that someone murders them and steals their identity). Your ID is a high-value target, so make sure no one gets their grubby hands on it. You also have access to the Security Door Control Remote, which you can use to bolt down certain doors in the brig.

Don't forget that your loot includes anything you might have created at the Security Protolathe or have confiscated from Traitors and other agents of chaos. It's best to keep these confiscated weapons and items away from the Officers; only let you or the Head of Security handle them. There's a better chance that the Head of Security will know how to put that gear to good use. 

## Implants

The Armory contains different sets of implants which you may want to make use of for prisoner control.

### Chemical Implants

Will put a chemical implant under the skin of a person's chest. Load the implant with up to 50 units of chemicals by injecting it with a filled syringe while it's still in its original case. You can then remotely inject the implanted chems with the Prisoner Management Console in your office.
Implant will last so long as the subject is alive. However, if the subject suffers from malnutrition, the implant may become unstable and either pre-maturely inject the subject or simply break. Can be loaded with sedatives or even lethal injections. For larger doses, a subject may be implanted multiple times. Disintegrates 10 minutes after the death of the host, unless revived. Also leaves a blinking blue dot if the subject is observed with a Security HUD.

### Tracking Implants

Will implant a tracking beacon under the skin of a person's chest. The Prisoner Management Console in your office can then be used to check the implanted person's location and even send messages into their mind. Use a bluespace locator to track implanted targets. Locators can be printed from the security techfab after research. Use a Hand Teleporter or Teleporter to teleport to the target. Disintegrates 10 minutes after the death of the host, unless revived. Also leaves a blinking red dot if the subject is observed with a Security HUD.

### Mindshield Implants

Mindshield Implants will revert the effects of Revolutionaries, however if someone resists them they are most likely the ringleader. Mindshield implants will also prevent brainwashing from Commies and Cultists. However they cannot deconvert anyone but a revolutionary. More can be ordered in the Cargo Bay, albeit at an extremely high cost.

All Security forces are automatically implanted at the beginning of the shift, so ensure all security personnel are Mindshield implanted by checking your Security HUD. Sometimes you'll catch someone impersonating, an officer. 

# Don't Just Sit Around

Sitting at your desk is alright, but you should make sure to scan the cell blocks every once in a while to make sure no one is hurt in the cells, or that no one has broken in. Your job is to protect all of security from people busting in, or out. A quick sweep every few minutes should be fine, being a warden is a mostly relaxing job, just make sure to stun anyone who looks suspicious in the brig (or security office area) and hold them till the head of security comes. Remember, DISARM FIRST, kill if that's your only option.

If you are going to sit around, the least you can do is update the security records for your prisoners and anyone mentioned on the radio.

Do not forget to check on the Armory once in a while. While it may seem impenetrable, there are ways people can get inside without a loud boom.

# Clearance Level Check

Referring back to the chain of command, remember that the Head of Personnel is not your superior, nor are they a member of the security team. If they are trying to break into the armory without prior authorization throw them in a cell so the Head of Security or Captain can have a talk with them. Remember they might not be the Head of Personnel at all!!

This goes double for anyone promoted to security. If the clown or mime shows up requesting gear, check with the Head of Security first. The Head of Security is the first and only authority on who may or may not be promoted to security.

Make sure that all officers and heads of staff have a mindshield implant or else you might have a bad time. 

# Lockdown

Sometimes, things get so bad you need to close everything off. You luckily have access to a grid of buttons nearby in your office, allowing you to selectively activate lockdown shutters and blast doors on the front of the Brig, the front desk at the entrance to the Brig, the Perma wing, and the Armory. Use this when the angry mob shows up to bust down the front door of the Brig.

Additionally, you can use the Deployable Barrier Grenades found in the Armory to quickly seal areas. They are essentially a super strong version of the wooden barricades that can be built. Once damaged they can be repaired with a welder. 

# Prison Wing

Monkestation's secure Prison Wing. Once you check in, you don't check out. There are no times here - this is a place for hardened criminals. Expect to use this rarely, as many traitors get killed before this becomes an option. Only you, the Head of Security, or the Captain should ever be taking people to it and only for the most heinous crimes.

For some reason, Nanotrasen has equipped all the prisoners with backpacks where they can store contraband. However, it is considered griefing to remove these.

If you do not pay attention, sometimes the Prison Wing may become a death camp. Periodically check it and make sure shitcurity, space carp, other traitors, or micro-meteors aren't abusing the prisoners. 

# Labor Camp

Monkestation has a completely functional labor camp. Consider sending prisoners here if they are particularly unruly and need a well-deserved vacation from the station. Before sending a prisoner to labor camp use a prisoner ID and set a point goal for them to achieve. Make sure to point out the card console in the labor ship as it is often overlooked. Prisoners are given a Sleeper, toilets and mining equipment. Be aware that many a foolish officer has died to the labor camp pickaxe. For this reason and many others be very cautious when sending prisoners here. Again, remember to give the prisoners a point goal or else they may be stuck there forever.

# Tips

Tips

- Keep a very close eye on the back of the Armory. Most stations have an external security camera in space outside the armory that can be viewed through a security camera console. It is common for crafty individuals to dismantle or even detonate the back portion of the Armory from Space. If you can hear them using their tools before they finish, you might be able to grab a Security Hardsuit in time to get out there and catch them!
- Your Krav Maga gloves are a very strong part of your personal gear. They give all of your shove attacks the chance to disarm an item from an opponent, placing it straight into your hand. You also gain abilities through 3 action buttons, pressing them will turn your next attack into the ability instead. The Leg Sweep instantly knocks down opponents and deals some stamina damage, follow it up with a shove or a stun baton. The Lung Punch does high oxygen damage; a few lung punches can knock out any hooligans causing trouble for a good 5 minutes. The Neck Chop makes the target mute for a short time; this is only really useful for preventing the Wizard from speaking spells, if you can even get in range without being turned to dust.
- If you can both mute and stun the Wizard, you can then safely handcuff them, remove their robes, and put a muzzle on them to render the wizard useless. (Keep in mind that the wizard could still use wands and melee weapons while muted) Successfully taking a wizard into custody is the highest achievement a warden can accomplish.
- Keep watch for any suspicious individuals loitering outside the Brig. Believe it or not, a lot of Officers die just after they walk out the doors of the Brig. Even worse, someone could be preparing to set up a nasty suprise for you.
- Try not to visibly harm the human prisoners out in the open. You never know when the ever-present AI might be watching you dish out some pain to some criminal scum. Despite them being criminals, it is the AI's job to prevent human harm. This may change however if anyone decides to program the AI's laws differently.
