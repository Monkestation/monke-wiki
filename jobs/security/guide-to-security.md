# Guide to Security

\[ head_of_security_image ]
> Head of Security Ben Mothman says:
"The Nanotrasen security force welcomes you, recruit. The path you have chosen is certainly a daunting one, but the most rewarding and defining of Nanotrasen standards here and abroad!
\..
BUT WAIT! Before you run off and knock the clown senseless with your stunbaton, you should read the things below." 


# Who Orders Who?
- Security Officers and the Detective all share the same rank. The Warden has authority in Brig but can have some of the authority delegated from HoS. The Head of Security is at the top of the security hierarchy. All security members take orders from him, and he takes his orders from the Captain.
- Department guards report directly to the Head of Security but may be dismissed from their post by the department head.
- The Head of Personnel is not part of the security hierarchy and should not heavily involve himself in security affairs. The HoP cannot order security around and cannot enter secure areas such as the Armory without authorization from the HoS or Captain.

# Security Equipment
Being well geared up can easily make the difference between the outcome of a tight situation. The next steps will show you one way to equip yourself, you can however wear your gear as you like.

The main thing behind this is that you want to be as ready as possible for even the most uncertain of events.



1. In case you've just joined the security force, you need to get your security jumpsuit, helmet, armour, jackboots, gloves and a security bowman headset (which provides flashbang protection) on.
1. Go to the Security Office and open a security locker.
1. Get HUD glasses and put them on.
1. Security Gas Mask.png Get a Security Gas Mask from your internals box and put it on.
1. Take your Emergency Oxygen Tank (set to 16 kPa output) and put it in your pocket.
1. Take your ID Card and put it inside your PDA, then put your PDA into the ID slot.
1. Get your Security Belt and put it on. Your Security Belt comes preequipped with a Stun Baton, Flash, Flashbang, Pepperspray and Handcuffs.
1. Get some extra gear from the SecTech vending machine. Energy Bolas are recommended the most.
1. Get the Seclite from your locker and attach it to the Disabler or to your helmet (sweaty nerds do this).

This isn't an ultimate setup, you change it however you want. Get creative!
You should be looking something like this now: 

> Need image of hud here, showing the inventory.
{.is-warning}

All you need to do now is keep your Security Belt open so you'll have quick access to the items in case of an emergency and be prepared for most things the station's going to throw at you! 

Also, make sure you understand what the icons on your Security HUD mean. For further info about security equipment, refer to the List of Security Items.

**Don't run around with your disabler or baton out!** You will get disarmed and your weapons will be stolen. Not only will the rest of the security team laugh at you, but you've also potentially armed some very dangerous people, putting the safety of the entire station in jeopardy. Keep your weapons secured until you need them! 

## Security Robots
- Officer Beepsky is often all but forgotten until you hear his cold, cruel voice shout out to you. Securitron models have been documented to capture even the most hardened criminals where security fails. If you're in a tight spot, you can call Beepsky to you by using your PDA.
- While Beepsky's rudimentary orders can be accessed from security computers, silicons are not within the normal chain of command. They are subject the AI and follow the same laws.
-  Don't kill silicons for trying to stop you from executing someone. It's required of them by their laws. Do note there is a difference between a silicon stopping you from executing someone, and a silicon bolting down all of security because of one officer. They'll be treated differently.

# [Law](https://wiki.monkestation.com/en/space-laws)
[Space Law](https://wiki.monkestation.com/en/space-laws) is a summary of most crimes with some suggested sentence times. Avoid stacking (in particular) minor/medium crimes when deciding on brig times, unless the criminal has really bad behaviour. Instead prefer shorter sentences such as a couple of minutes in the brig, or 50 points in the gulag instead of 500 for inciting a riot, unless the crime is severe or griefy in nature. Sometimes the Captain determines what is lawful and what isn't (within reason), but don't obey the Captain if you're told to "purge all non-humans" or similar.

**Standard Operating Procedures**
- You have stun/non-lethal weapons, USE THEM. Don't kill if you're not in serious danger.
- You are an enforcer of Space Law, you're not The Law.
- Be wary of people with harmful intentions. You should use minimal force, but not at the risk of your own life.
- Communicate with your team, ask the HoS/Warden for orders and respond to calls for help (you can highlight the word help in chat).
- More information about the Standard Operating Procedure during different code levels.

# Demotions
Insubordination and dereliction of duty are crimes under Space Law, so occasionally a Head of Staff might request your assistance in demoting one of their subordinates. In such cases, you are to accompany them as they confront the subordinate, or are asked to arrest someone who has abandoned their workplace and fled. In either case, ensure that you secure their ID and all items related to the job (i.e. tools and gloves from engineers) and return them to the head at your earliest convenience. The head can then remove the departmental access from the ID and return it to the demoted person.

# Arrest Procedure

> this is from the tg wiki and does not suit our playerbase, this will need rewritten.
{.is-warning}

Arrests and detainments are the things you will do the most.

You should arrest people who you witness breaking the law or who are set to the warrant. When approaching a person set to the warrant, read his crimes to evaluate the danger level. 
## Low-Threat Criminals
Low-threat criminals are usually the ones who commit petty or non-violent crimes.

The best arrest procedure for them is: 
1.		Get their attention
-				You can do this using the Security Gas Mask Hailer feature
2.		Tell them they're under arrest and state their crimes
3.		Get them into handcuffs
-				If they seem non-compliant or getting agitated - stun them
4.		Bring them to Brig
Getting in proximity to them and starting to put handcuffs on them is rather risky, as that makes you very vulnerable. As such you're expected to get them stunned first, but this doesn't mean you have to use your weapons. You can take out a Security Pen from your PDA on click on it, this will prompt them to surrender which will stun them if they accept surrender. 
## High-Threat Criminals
High-threat criminals are the ones who commit violent crimes and are dangerous to anyone around them.

The best arrest procedure for them is: 
1. 		Stun them
1. 		Get them into handcuffs
1. 		Tell them they're under arrest and state their crimes
1. 		Bring them to Brig
## Enemy of Corporations
Enemy of Corporations are people who are working for one of the organizations counted as the enemy of the Nanotrasen. They're assumed to be extremely dangerous and hostile.

1.		 Call in backup upon spotting them
-  		Keep track of their positions but do not engage alone
2. 		Once backup arrives, stun the enemy
-  		The best way to do it is to coordinate with your teammates to block off all of his escape routes
3. 		Get them into handcuffs
4. 		Bring them to Brig

# The Brig / Punishments
[Instructions on how to correctly brig a prisoner can be found here.](https://wiki.monkestation.com/space-laws#brigging)

Punishments should fit the crime. Use your best judgment and try to give people the benefit of the doubt. Consider the following examples:

Robert Marshal, an assistant, is arrested for running into Medbay and taking a stethoscope. They've been very cooperative with security personnel.

DO

        Confiscate the stethoscope and return it to Medbay when possible
        Remove any items that could be used to break out and place them in the cell locker
        Set a fair timer on the brig cell, one to two minutes
        Uncuff the prisoner, leaving them to buckle cuffed is considered poor form

DON'T

        Confiscate items that were unrelated to the crime (tools, gloves)
        Beat the prisoner unless they are actively resisting arrest
        Give a ten-minute sentence

The shaft miner, Tyler Stevens, broke into engineering from space and immediately began attacking a station engineer.

DO

        Remove their EVA suit, any mining tools or other items. Have the detective work his magic on the weapons to confirm what happened.
        Set a reasonable timer on the cell, or send them to the gulag for a similar sentence.
        Interview witnesses, the victim and the assailant. Ascertain what happened. There's almost always something else going on.
        Inform the Warden or Head of Security and ask them to take over if they say the prisoner is to be permabrigged.

DON'T

        Beat the prisoner to the point where they're critically injured or worse.
        Strip their items in the rapidly depressurizing engineering room.
        Let a lynch mob harm your prisoner.
        Refuse their request to speak with legal counsel.

An energy sword is found in maintenance. The detective scans it and finds one set of fingerprints and several sets of blood. The prints belong to Jane Conway, the curator. She is subsequently arrested and hauled into the brig.

DO

        Strip all of their posessions and put them in an orange prisoner jumpsuit. Confiscate any contraband and turn it the Warden.
        Inform the Head of Security.
        Interrogate the prisoner. Perhaps they have more contraband hidden elsewhere, or they're working with another enemy of the corporation.
        Allow them to speak to a lawyer. If they wish to be put on trial, attempt to facilitate that.

DONT

        Beat them to death on the spot.
        Talk about executing them or otherwise harming them. Your silicon friends won't take kindly to that.
        Refuse to negotiate. There are an infinite number of options besides tossing someone in perma or executing them.

To sum up, acting in good faith and treating prisoners fairly ultimately leads to more trust between security and the rest of the crew. Every incident is different and will have its own unique set of factors that ultimately determine the outcome. Security should be busting heads infrequently. 

## Permabrigging
Captain, Acting Captain or Head of Security (or, in their absence, Warden) permission is required to permanently lock someone up. You do not NEED the Captain if the HoS is available.

Punishment via throwing them into permabrig should fit the crime. Did whatever they did to deserve such a sentence affect anyone? Were they harmful? Are they the kind of person who just comes back for more and more constantly? Permabrigging someone for stealing something and running away through secure areas versus permabrigging someone who's shot and killed people. One is a much less severe crime.

# Lethal Force / Executions
- If something poses a constant threat, you are free to use lethal force. This includes dangerous nonhuman creatures, changelings, nuclear operatives, cultists, and wizards.
- If hulks are smashing shit, you are free to use lethal force on them. If someone's using their stun immunity to go around smashing stuff for no reason you are allowed to kill them - "no reason" being the keywords. Don't kill hulks that are breaking stuff for good reasons (like when the rogue as shit AI is flooding plasma)
- If someone is shooting at you with lethal weaponry you are free to respond in kind.
- Once you have someone stunned and cuffed, there is usually no excuse to not take them to the brig/permabrig if they aren't one of the above-listed threats. Beating a common criminal, who is already down and unable to fight back, to death is shit. Some circumstances may change this. Don't let your guard down.
- Executions are to be authorized by the Captain or acting Captain, if available. If neither is available, it is up to the HoS or acting HoS. If security is in agreement that the Captain is unfit for command, they may defer to the HoS. Whoever authorizes an execution will ultimately be held responsible by admins.
- When considering whether or not to execute someone, consider their crimes; did they murder people with an e-bow, or did they just emag 1-2 doors? It's perfectly reasonable to execute someone for the former. Yes, you could execute someone for emagging as well, but consider sticking them with a lethal chemical implant or even sending them to be borged. Neutralizing a threat posed by an antagonist is reasonable, but removing that player from the round is dishonourable.
- In instances where nonlethal force is not an option or not a good idea, e.g. someone in space breaking into the Armory, firing lasers at them through the windows isn't going to get you in trouble.
- Revolution is a special case for execution authorization, considering everyone is swarming you at once, so use your best judgment. Don't forget your Mindshield Implants!
- See the Rules section for more details.

# Dealing With Threats, Minimal Force
As a Security Officer, you are expected to fight any and every hostile force assaulting the station, from traitorous crew members to powerful reality-defying Wizards to teams of "crack" syndicate assault forces. You must know how to counter any and all threats that are thrown at you, preferably with minimal force needed on your part. Remember, however, that not only is the station's peace at risk, but your very life is on the line; fail and you will die! Here is NT's staple guide on suggested courses of action against expected threats. 
## Tiders
Single tiders can be punished with a timed brig sentence like any other criminal. If they come back looking for trouble, again and again, start asking about a perma sentence. A "three-strikes" rule is a generally accepted standard.
Criminals screaming that security is rogue or murderous (when they're actually not) should be threatened with a stint in perma.
In cases of a full-on invasion by Assistants (a greytide), lethal force (within reason) is justified. Don't be afraid to crack a few skulls if it means keeping the Armory secure.
A persistent greytider should be admin-helped once all possible IC solutions have been evaluated. If the same person is behaving horribly as a non-antag across multiple rounds it may be bannable. 
## Traitors
Traitors range in hostility and thus are a mixed bag to tackle, standard ranged stunning is recommended in dealing with confirmed traitors. If someone is suspected of being a Traitor, get several Officers to search the person in question and possibly search their department for hidden items. Interviews with witnesses and victims can help in proving the guilt of a possible Traitor. You should generally offer the chance for a perp to surrender before engaging unless they are actively hostile. In the case of overt traitors, however, you will need to respond with a proportionate level of force.
- Improvised Weapons: Order the AI to lock down the area, assess if civilians are at risk and use ranged stun weapons to subdue the perp. They are a low-risk threat to you unless they are somehow able to stun you.
- Stolen Station Weapons: Assume they are carrying at minimum a ranged firearm capable of stunning. Ask the AI to locate and lock down the area. Multiple Officers should attempt to simultaneously attack the perp. The use of Flashbangs will prove effective if the perp is well entrenched.
- Syndicate Weapons: The suspect should be presumed to be armed and dangerous, and AI should report and track the perp's location. Do not approach without backup. Consider asking the Warden/Head of Security to issue Riot Shields and Energy Guns. If the suspect is wielding Dual Energy Swords, ranged energy weapons (including disablers) will prove ineffective. Flashbangs, stun batons, shotguns or the Detective's revolver will be suitable (just be sure the detective doesn't kill the suspect).
- Spray Bottle: A unique "device". Small amounts of water can slip people for long periods of time, making them drop their weapons. If the suspect is reported to possess a Spray Bottle or Fire Extinguisher, do not approach without walking. If the suspect is using ranged weapons in conjunction, be wary and avoid getting into a bad situation. Consider getting Cargo to order Galoshes or ambush the traitor.
## Changelings
Changelings are alien entities that have infiltrated the station. They can easily change their appearance at a moment's notice. If there are confirmed sightings of Changelings, be wary. Sometimes you will encounter one with bio-organic armour, a shield that stops ranged disablers in their tracks, and an incredibly deadly arm blade. Don't underestimate them under any circumstances! Due to their abilities, it is possible for a Changeling to kill a fellow Sec Officer and impersonate him. However, you should note that they will lack a Mindshield Implant unless they had themselves implanted. Be wary of Sec Officers without Implants, as they should be arrested or kept under close watch. While you are free to terminate a confirmed Changeling, you must be 100% certain that the suspect is a Changeling before executing. If you cannot prove they are a Changeling, ask the Warden/HoS to give them a Chem/Tracking implant to watch their future activities. So if Joe Innocent walks out of the brig with a Chem Implant displaying a red or blue dot above their head on the SecHUD, and later on you see Alex Antag with the same dot, you will know that they are probably Changeling.

The same standard tactics in subduing a Traitor apply to subduing a Changeling, however, do be wary that some Changelings can get up instantly after being stunned and sometimes melt their handcuffs. If they do, you may need to switch to lethal. 
## Nuclear Operatives
A five-man team of operatives are tasked with assaulting your station, stealing the Nuclear Authentication Disk, and destroying the station via a thermonuclear device. You must make every effort to stop them. During a nuclear threat, you are recommended to ignore most other crimes on the station. You need the crew to fight alongside you.

The Nuke Ops are equipped with a deadly array of weapons and devices that are better than yours in every regard. Guns can knock you down and kill you with a few rounds. Assault mechs and cyborgs that can tear a hole into wherever they goddamn please. Hardsuits that offer protection from the hazards of space, ballistic and energy weapons. This is a team of five-ish hardass sons of bitches who won't go down without a fight, and they'll probably explode if you manage to take 'em down. Proceed with caution.

Upon the confirmation of Nuclear Operatives, get the Warden/HoS to open the armoury and distribute weapons. At the same time, confirm the location of the nuke disk, which should hopefully be on the Captain, and ensure that it stays as far away from the ops as possible. From this point, you should prioritize protecting the disk at all costs. Consider asking for a bulletproof vest and helmet, since nuke ops often use bullets, and bulletproof vests block 80% of bullet damage to the chest and head, which can be very helpful. If the AI is still alive at this point, make sure it calls the shuttle.

When fighting nuke ops, use numbers and cover to your advantage. Avoid exposing yourself and concentrate on one Operative at a time. If you can attack an isolated operative, go for it. If you own an op, attempt to strip as much of its gear as you can before the op triggers its explosive implant. Remember that as long as the disk is with you, you only need to defend, so don't give up that advantage until you have to.

If you encounter a Mech, fall back and regroup. The only way to take down a mech is with concentrated firepower or an ion weapon (like the rifle in the armoury or HoS personal laser.

The Syndicate Cyborg, like regular cyborgs, is immune to stun weaponry. Your best bet for countering one of these is to flash it with your flash or a flashbang and then go to town on it with your stun baton or another melee weapon.

Securing the Disk is your number one priority. Keep the disk bearer alive at all costs and protect it. If you have a choice between killing an operative and saving the disk, save the disk! If you lose the disk, quickly secure EVA gear and scour the exterior of the station to find the Ops. If you are lucky you can catch them trying to arm the nuke. A pinpointer helps greatly in this situation.
## Wizard
An extremely powerful entity, if a Wizard is confirmed, rally the Security and arm up with the best weapons you can get. The best way to terminate a Wizard is to stick together and focus fire on them. Shotguns are ideal weapons. Wear them down with a constant shotgun or laser-fire. Do not go at them alone or you will die. If you can safely stun them, either open fire with lasers or remove their clothing to shut down most of their spells. Do not enter into melee range unless you can confirm that they cannot use Disintegrate or Magic Missiles.

If by some miracle you are able to subdue a Wizard, immediately secure them with cuffs, a straightjacket and a muzzle. This will usually shut them down completely and render them harmless. At this point, your greatest threat is the crew trying to kill the helpless Wizard. If you still wish to preserve their life, move to the Brig and push back people trying to kill them. Generally, at this point, the living Captain/HoS/Warden/Clown will either perform an execution or a trial for the Wizard.
> no idea if the "Friend the Friendly" part is breaking rules or not. will talk to ben about it.
{.is-warning}

Remember, even if the Wizard is named "Friend the Friendly", repeatedly says "I'm a friendly Wizard", and carries around a staff of healing, you are still allowed to kill it.

## Revolutionaries
Sometimes, a few crew members will have enough and rebel against the command staff and the security forces. Your job is to stop them at all costs and protect the command staff. Revolutionaries are as deadly as a traitor with improvised weapons, however, their greatest strength is their numbers. Disablers, energy guns and stun batons are useless against a swarm of 10 to 20 people clambering over the stunned and twitching bodies of fellow revs to get at your throat.

When you subdue a Revolutionary, you should mindshield implant them as fast as possible. This will remove their revolutionary status and prevent them from being converted again. If you cannot get access to a mindshield implant, simply targeting their head (make sure to remove any armoured helmet) and smacking them with your stun baton using Rightclick.pngCombat 32.pngHarm 32.pngHelp 32.png will eventually deconvert them assuming they don't die first. However, even if successful, they will still be vulnerable to re-conversion. Another note: although you can no longer beat the revolutionary fervour out of someone once they have left this mortal coil, a mindshield implant will still work on dead revolutionaries.

If you mindshield implant someone and you get a message saying they "seem to resist the implant", they are a head revolutionary! You will need to exile them off the station z level or, more commonly, kill them if you want to defeat the revolution.

Work with your fellow security, the heads of staff, and other mindshielded crew to suppress the revolution. Oftentimes, revolutions are decided by which side can secure key departments/resources first; don't be afraid to mindshield implant crew in key departments even if you do not know they are a revolutionary, since it will prevent them from being converted later. Once you have a sufficiently large supply of mindshields, implanting random crew in the hallways is also justifiable.

Generally speaking, the most important departments initially are cargo and medbay. Cargo will be a vital battleground fought over, as it acts both as a critical source of mindshield implants for security and a source of weapons for the Revolutionaries. Medbay oftentimes becomes an early revolutionary hub, and a strong revolutionary medbay can make it very difficult to get security/command healed and revived. Science is the next most important department, not only for its ability to produce extremely dangerous mechs, bombs, mutations, golems and other items but also because of the possibility of an AI subversion. If the revolutionaries manage to subvert the AI, counter-subverting it should be your top priority. A subverted AI will shock and bolt all of the Brig doors, liberally grant all access to revolutionaries, cancel all of your mindshield orders, and generally make your life hell.

Engineering, while still dangerous, is less so than the other departments. Service and non-departmental crew (i.e. Assistants) are the lowest priority out of all. 
## Cultists
Similar to Revolutionaries in a few respects, their goal is to sacrifice a specific crewmember and then summon Nar'Sie.

Fighting Cultists requires all hands on deck. You must be vigilant in fighting Cultists. Anyone outside of security and the Captain can be a Cultist. Work together to lock down the station, declare martial law (red alert), perform random searches for cult items and crack down on departments. Use force as necessary if people try to swarm you or follow you around.

When you capture a Cultist, your options are limited. Unlike Revs, mindshield implants do not revert their Cult-status, and only force the cult to sacrifice non-cultists and turn them into constructs instead of converting them. As such, you have few options. 

- Deconversion: You should be aiming to deconvert all captured cultists, however at times this may not be viable (Usually during a shortage of Holy Water). See How to Deconvert a Cultist with Holy Water. A cultist can't be summoned by other cultists if cuffed and either grabbed or buckled.
- Permabrigging: Don't bother. Cultists can create a new ritual dagger from nothing, and can just teleport out. can be used as a temporary solution while preparing to deconvert them, and secure the cultist with a straightjacket.
- Forced Borging: Borgs can both be stunned and converted into constructs by cultists, so this isn't really worth the effort.
- Execution: A controversial approach both in-game and out-game. This removes the Cultist permanently and removes the threat. It is quick and easy without any unneeded effort on your part. However if the AI and borgs witness or find evidence of this, the AI can be obligated to shut you down to prevent further human harm. You are free to kill confirmed cultists, especially when pentagram halos have appeared over their heads. But deconversion is the preferred solution.

# Security Tactics
Being a Security member is all about teamwork, everything gets much easier and more effective once you work as a team.

There will be several tactics you can utilize as an Officer, or enforce in your department as HoS. (Try not to boss around while HoS is around) 
## Buddy System
The Buddy System involves every Officer having a buddy who follows them at all times, as such those 2 Officers work as a pair. Usually, 2 Officers assigned to the same department are paired together.

Working in a pair makes it much easier for Officers to engage threats, one officer can report the crime to the Security channel while the other can start immediate engagement. This also lowers casualty rates, attacking two officers at once is harder than attacking one.

You can also use this to train Deputies on how Security works, just make sure the Deputy is not traitorous or else his buddy Officer may suddenly disappear. 
## Task Force
Working as a Task Force (more commonly known as "Conga Line") can be extremely helpful if you're dealing with a large amount of threats or a single extremely powerful one. Usually, Task Forces are prepared for raids on departments infested with Revolutionaries and Cultists, or Traitors turfing.

First Task Force must be formed:


1. Get all Officers to the Brig
2. Brief Officers on the mission you will be carrying out
- You can assign code names to each Officer for quick reference during the mission
3. Officers appropriately
4. Grab the first Officer, first must grab the second and etc. Thus forming a "Conga Line"
-	To make sure the line doesn't break during movement, make sure everyone is on the Combat Mode
5. Once on the location of mission work as planned at the briefing
-	Communication is the key to success, provide intel and command the movements.

# Security Controlled Locations
- The Brig: The Warden runs this. If you're in here, the Armory or any other part of the security sector he has authority over you. The Brig itself has cells and cell timers.
- Prison Wing: The prison wing is used to indefinitely hold criminals charged with major crimes. Like the Brig, the Warden has authority over this area. However, transferring a prisoner in and out should not be done without authorization from the Warden or someone superior.
- Security Office: The Security Office is attached to the Brig. It contains the Head of Security's Office, a SecTech vending machine, security computers, and a couple of equipment lockers.
- Security Posts: Small Security Posts are in each of the station's four major departments: Cargo, Medbay, Research and Engineering. These offices each have a security records computer.
- Armory: The Armory contains additional weapons and armour that the Head of Security and Warden have access to. They should hand out these weapons in case of increased danger, such as a revolution or syndicate invasion.
- Do not secure the Armory without a justifiable reason. "I expect people to try to break in" is not acceptable, that's called metagaming.
- If someone is actually TRYING to break in? By all means, move the weapons. Don't move them at roundstart without any real reason other than to dick over antags who go through the trouble of getting all the way in undetected.
- Arrival Checkpoint: This checkpoint is near the Arrival Shuttle. It has an ID computer that the HoP can man as well as other security computers. There is also a locker with security gear. If you're a late-joining Security Officer, it might be a good idea to take the equipment from here, assuming it hasn't already been ransacked. 
# Citations and Fines
For minor crimes, you may choose to give the culprit a citation (containing a fine) instead of brig time. Officers can issue a citation and a fine (up to 1000 credits) from a security records console. If you get a citation, a PDA message will alert you how much the fine is. You can pay your fines at any security warrant console, located outside the brig, in a law office, or in the courtroom public area.

Not paying a fine has no automatic consequences. 
# Evacuation
So the escape shuttle has been called! Your job will be to ensure that everyone proceeds on the shuttle in an orderly fashion.

Usually, by the time the shuttle is called, there are already several highly dangerous criminals on the warrant, in this case, Security might want to set a checkpoint at the departures (using holo-barriers) to identify everyone boarding the shuttle. Only don't block the entrance with them.

At the shuttle you should keep the order, this can be rather challenging as shuttles most of the time resemble tin cans filled with extremely annoyed and angry fish. Help heads evict trespassers at the cockpit, and arrest anyone breaking down the order.

Prisoners in the Brig should only be released at the Warden's discretion. Prisoners from the Prison Wing should be moved to the Security Escape Pod or to the Escape Shuttle's brig where they will be held until the shuttle docks at CentCom. 
# Key Points
- Ask first, stun second, unless there's substantial evidence that the perpetrator has nothing to lose.
- Being unnecessarily harsh is generally frowned upon, even if it's in Space Law.
- It is highly encouraged to only arrest Heads of Staff with approval from HoS or Captain (unless they are clearly dangerous).
- Only the Captain, HoS or Warden can authorize a permanent sentence.
- Your job isn't to be a tyrant or your suspects will be praying to the Gods (read: Admins) for ultimate justice. Make sure you follow standard protocol so that the Gods smile down upon you.
- If an Admin contacts you, please explain to them what happened. Just because you're a Security Officer doesn't mean you're wrong by default. Don't throw a tantrum, you'll only make things worse.
- It's just a game so have fun the way you want to.
