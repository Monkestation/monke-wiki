# Artifact Science 101

Also known as ArtSci (or *Artificium Scientiae* for the more verbose among those on our payroll), Artifact Science is one of the most lethal duties aboard Monke Station.

For the sake of your own safety, the safety of others and the safety of Central Commands' budget, you will be *expected* to follow these steps of Standard Operating Procedure **BEFORE** even attempting to touch, smell or so much as exist in the general viscinity of an unidentified artifact.

1. Get yourself clone scanned. This is inarguable and is a preventative measure against the inevitable.
1. Collect a monkey cube (or two, a little extra never hurt anyone sentient) and a pair of cable ties.
1. Get yourself suited up in a biosuit, sometimes Science has one or two in the entry airlock to their department, *but not always*. At worst, you can always order one from Cargo.
1. Have at least one bottle of multiver ready, Medbay always has a few spare either on tables or in the smart fridges at the Pharmacy.

And that's all you'll need to begin with! Keep in mind this list does not fully prepare you for all the dangers you may face and as such it is advised you keep looking at the wall of text in front of you. I mean you're a scientist already (I hope), so you should be good at this whole reading thing... Right?
# Fuckin' space rocks, how do they work?
Now I can already see you looking at those artifacts that the lab has pre-prepared, practically foaming at the mouth and ready to touch throw yourself at them like the deranged scientsist with a death wish that you are but **HOLD IT**.

There are ways to go about this that don't involve you becoming a cyborg for the rest of forever!

For a first, don't actually be the one to touch the artifact in the first place. How do you do that you might be wondering? Well, that's what the monkey cubes I mentioned earlier were for! Spray one down with a fire extinguisher, cable tie the resulting chimp and grab them.

Upon dragging them next to the artifact, and (if this were a game) clicking on the artifact will, instead of touching the artifact yourself, cause the monkey to touch it in your place. Potentially taking the brunt of any possible bad effects caused by that artifact spontaneously activating.
