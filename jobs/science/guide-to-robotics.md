# Guide to Robotics

Are you a Roboticist? This guide will explain the creation and maintenance of Cyborgs, bots, MODsuits, and stocky Exosuits. 

> For MODsuits, click [here]. For Exosuits (MECHS), click [here]. (pages to be added soon.)

# Exosuit Fabricators

These are the main machines used in Robotics, with them you can create various exosuit and cyborg parts and their upgrade modules. Remember to sync these with the R&D servers frequently for new equipment designs and increased production speeds.

If one (or more) of the Exosuit Fabricators gets stuck at updating from R&D servers, use a screwdriver on it and then crowbar that fucker! Remove any metal/glass sheets and then put all the components back into the machine frame, use a screwdriver at the end to reassemble the Exosuit Fabricator. 

Generic borg.png Cyborgs

Total Part Cost: 100000 Metal (give or take)
Requires
1 x each Cyborg part (made with the Exosuit Fabricator)
2 x Flash (Exosuit Fabricator)
1 x Cable Coil
1 x Power Cell (preferably at least High-Capacity)
1 x Brainâ†’ MMI OR positronic brain OR B.O.R.I.S. module 

The Cyborg is the Roboticist's primary creation. They are tasked with helping the station's inhabitants in their daily life and trying to kill everyone when the AI is insane. Each cyborg is required to follow the AI's laws, and may choose one of the AIs in the event that more than one exists.

Assuming you already have the necessary components:

1. Power Cell Insert a charged power cell into the cyborg's chest
1. Cable Coil Insert a coil of wire into the cyborg's chest
1. Flash Insert two flashes in the cyborg's head (one for each eye socket)
1. For final assembly, take each component and apply it to the cyborg endoskeleton
1. Multitool Multitools can be used to give cyborgs names. Simply apply the multitool before the brain is installed. Note that calling a borg 'PenisShitter 5000' will not net you any new friends, however.
1. Brain Once it's complete, it's time for the brain. See here how to remove your volunteer's brain. (If the brain has been removed from the head without surgery, you will need to pour mannitol on it to fix it)
1. MMI Now put the brain into your MMI, and then the MMI into the cyborg suit. Congratulations, your cyborg is complete. Put the brainless corpse into a body bag and deliver it to the Morgue (or throw it down the disposals because ROBOTICS!). If when you insert the MMI into the cyborg it says "This MMI does not seem to fit." it means the user is job banned from cyborg.
1. Instead of a brain, you can insert a positronic brain (controlled by a ghost) or B.O.R.I.S. module (controlled by the AI) into the cyborg as well.

# Cyborg Maintenance

In the beginning of a maintenance process, you need to open the Cyborg's maintenance cover. To open it:

- Use an ID Card, Emag it or just ask the Cyborg to unlock its panel
- Use a Crowbar to open the cover.

After the maintenance process use the same tools in reverse order so the Cyborg doesn't run around with its cover open, like so:
- Use a Crowbar to close the cover.
- Use your ID Card to lock the Cyborg. Borgs can't lock their panel.

## Cyborg Repairs

Cyborgs will often come to you for repairs if damaged.

For brute damage:

- Weld them to fix the dents.

For burn damage:

- Unlock and open the Cyborg's cover.
- Use an Empty Hand to remove the battery.
- Screwdriver to expose wiring.
- Rewire the damaged circuits with cable coils. You may have to do this step more than once.
- Screwdriver to hide wiring.
- Re-insert the old battery or insert a new one.
- Close the cover and lock the Cyborg.

Engineering cyborgs can repair dents on themselves and on their fellow cyborgs. They cannot repair burn damage though, since they cannot remove power cells to reach the wiring.

## Cyborg Batteries

You will often see at least one Cyborg come to your assembly line to ask for an upgrade.

- Unlock and open the Cyborg's cover.
- With an Empty Hand, remove the old battery.
- Insert a New Battery.
- Close the cover and lock the Cyborg.

## Cyborg Radios

Cyborgs can be installed with radio encryption keys, allowing them to communicate on secure department channels.

- Unlock and open the Cyborg's cover.
- Encryption key.png Insert a New Encryption Key (or Screwdriver to remove the current Key).
- Close the cover and lock the Cyborg.

## Reviving Cyborgs

A cyborg that has failed but not been turned into scrap can be repaired back to working order.

- Create an Emergency Restart Module at the Exosuit Fabricator (under Cyborg Upgrade Modules).
- Repair the Cyborg with a welder and/or replace wires.
- Unlock and open the Cyborg's cover.
- Insert the Emergency Restart Module.
- Close the cover and lock the Cyborg.

## Upgrading Cyborgs

- Unlock and open the Cyborg's cover.
- Insert the Upgrade Module (or emag to subvert).
- Close the cover and lock the Cyborg.

## Deconstructing Cyborgs

Cyborgs can be deconstructed to remove their MMI and get their parts back.

- Unlock and open the Cyborg's cover.
-  Use an Empty Hand to remove battery.
- Screwdriver to open wiring.
- Cut every wire until the lockdown light turns on.
- Wrench to disassemble.

(Alternatively, for steps 4 and 5, you can use a Robotics console)

## Upgrades

Roboticists can construct upgrade modules for cyborgs, such as one that increases your movement speed. Should you wish to change models, ask the roboticist to cut and mend your reset wire.

# Surgery

To initiate most surgeries, first place drapes over the part of the body you are operating on.

## Removing Brains
\[ BRAIN REMOVAL SURGERY ]

Despite what some old-timer Roboticists may tell you, DO NOT JUST TAKE THE BONESAW AND CUT THEIR HEAD OFF WITHOUT SURGERY. Removing a brain without surgery will damage it and may result in the immediate death of the brain.

In case this happens, you will need to ask the Chemist to make some Mannitol to fix it. Once you have a beaker of it, just splash it on the brain and it should be good to go. You can always examine the brain to see if it is still damaged.

If a head is not attached to a body, you can simply use a scalpel or some other slicing/cutting item on it to cut the brain out. No need for drapes or table. 

## Limb Augmentation

Replace a limb with a robot part. The head, torso, arms, and legs can all be augmented. Augmenting torso makes you immune to appendicitis and xeno larva.
Robot limbs are tougher. They need welding to "heal" brute damage and wires for burn damage, and cannot be otherwise healed. EMP pulses will hurt augmented humans.

\[ AUGMENT SURGERY ]

# Bots

As a Roboticist, you serve another important purpose: making robots. Robots can benefit the station in many ways, and are really damned easy to create. The current list of robots, and how to make them, is as follows:

**Remember**: All bots can be made through the crafting menu (T-like hammer hud-icon). This can save a lot of time during construction, especially if Robotics is busy! 

## Medibot

Performs a baby version of tend wounds. The surgery works through clothes and without the patient having to lie down. Amount healed scales with tend wounds surgeries researched. Each researched upgrade of tend wounds increases health healed. Requires a "refresh" similarly to operating computers to benefit from research.

When emagged it will inject 5u chloral hydrate and damage you based on what they would have healed (brute if you don't need treatment) per step.

What damage types the medibot can heal depends on medkit used. If they can heal multiple types the damage type healed will be random per treatment:

    Advanced first aid kit: All 4 basic damage types.
    Brute kit: 10% extra brute. (other types?)
    Burn kit: ?
    Toxin kit: ?
    Suffocation kit: ?

To manufacture: 

1 x Borg Arm (left or right)
1 x Med-kit (EMPTY, any color)
1 x Health Analyzer or First aid analyzer
1 x Proximity Sensor

- Attach the Borg Arm (left or right, doesn't matter) to an empty Med-kit. The color of the Med-kit determines what damage it will heal, as well as its future color (white and pink kits are both for brute dmg).
- You can pick the assembly up in your hand at this point and name it something clever/funny/stupid by holding your Pen in the other hand and clicking on it, if you wish.
- Add a Medical Analyzer.
- Insert the Proximity Sensor and your Medibot is ready!

## Cleanbot

Cleanbots are great, as they serve the exact same purpose as the Janitor. What makes it even better is that it uses Space Cleaner to mop, so no slipping on everything! When Emagged (or hacked) it will spew slippery foam and melt people with acid.

To manufacture: 

1 x Bucket
1 x Proximity Sensor
1 x Borg Arm (left or right) 

- Grab a bucket from the Janitor or make with Autolathe and insert the Proximity Sensor to it
- Use a Pen to name it if you wish.
- Attach a Borg Arm and your Cleanbot is ready!

## Floorbot

Floorbots are nice to have around when some asshole starts crowbarring up floor tiles or some traitor has blown apart a section of the station. They zoom around and repair busted floor tiles. Honestly, they're niche to the point of uselessness. But they make nice pets. Also, if emagged, they will deconstruct the floors into space.

To manufacture:

1 x Mechanical Toolbox Any toolbox
10 x Floor Tile
1 x Proximity Sensor
1 x Cyborg left arm.png Borg Right Arm

- Attach a Floor tile to the Mechanical Toolbox.
- Add the Proximity Sensor.
- Insert a Borg Right Arm and your Floorbot is ready!

## Firebot

This lil' guy will scoot around and try his best to extinguish burning people and gases around him. If emagged he will spray Chlorine Trifluoride at anyone who isn't on fire. Firebots retain full movement in space, and automatically dispense Firefighting Foam in a small radius around them in low-pressure conditions.

To manufacture:

1 x Fire Extinguisher
1 x Proximity Sensor
1 x Fire Helmet
1 x Cyborg right arm.png Borg Arm (left or right)

- Attach a Borg Arm (left or right) to the Fire Extinguisher.
- Add a Fire Helmet.
- Add a Proximity Sensor and your Firebot is ready.

## Honkbot

Annoying and useless, now with cuffing abilities. The clown might bug you to make one of these in absence of a H.O.N.K. mech. Can be of use to Security if there's no supplies for a Securitron. God forbid if a traitor emags the thing or if anyone puts a PAI into one.

To manufacture:

1 x Clown Box
1 x Clown Stamp
1 x Bike Horn
1 x Proximity Sensor
1 x Cyborg left arm.png Borg Arm (left or right)

- Stamp a piece of cardboard with the clown stamp. (You may need a clown for this step)
- Insert a Borg Arm
- Add a Proximity Sensor.
- Add a Bike Horn

## Vibebot

It's just out here vibing.

To manufacture:

2 x Light bulb
1 x Cyborg head
1 x Proximity Sensor
1 x Crayon

- Gather up the building materials.
- Use the crafting menu to assemble.

##  Hygienebot

Flying bot which showers people covered in blood, with force if necessary. Showers people in fire if Emaged

To manufacture:

2 x Metal
1 x Welding Tool
1 x Proximity Sensor
1 x Fluid Duct

- Use metal in hand to craft an incomplete hygienebot assembly.
- Weld a hole in the incomplete hygienebot assembly.
- Add a Proximity Sensor.
- Add a Fluid Duct.

## Securitron

Basically, Officer Beepsky without the personality. You usually won't need to build any of these, but they can be hilariously helpful for traitors who have invested in a Cryptographic Sequencer, as they tend to run around stunning and cuffing everyone in sight. Problem is, any of these that report a Level 10 Infraction when spotting people are obviously hacked.

To manufacture:

1 x Remote Signaling Device
1 x Helmet
1 x Welding Tool
1 x Proximity Sensor
1 x Cyborg right arm.png Borg Right Arm
1 x Stun Baton

- Use a Remote Signaling Device on a Helmet.
- Weld them together
- Add a Proximity Sensor.
- Insert a Borg Arm.
- Toss in a Stun Baton and your Securitron is ready!

Note: Destroying a Securitron or Officer Beepsky with a melee weapon is all but impossible by yourself; striking them causes them to immediately stun and cuff you. If you work with another person you can get several hits in while it is cuffing the other person, which is often enough to destroy it outright. 

## ED-209

**PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON. YOU HAVE 15 SECONDS TO COMPLY.**

Beepsky's bigger brother. Has all of the abilities of a standard Securitron with the addition of a ranged attack.

To manufacture:

1 x Cyborg Endoskeleton Cyborg Endoskeleton
1 x Metal Sheet
2 x Cyborg Leg Cyborg Leg
1 x Body Armor
1 x Welding Tool
1 x Helmet
1 x Proximity Sensor
1 x Cable Coil
1 x Disabler
1 x Screwdriver
1 x Power Cell

- Build a Cyborg Endoskeleton from the Exosuit Fabricator.
- Use a Metal Sheet on a Cyborg Endoskeleton to reinforce it.
- Add two Robot Legs
- Add a Body Armor
- Weld everything together
- Add in a security Helmet
- Attach a Proximity Sensor to the assembly
- Insert wires
- Add a Disabler and attach it with a Screwdriver
- Insert a Power Cell. Your own exosuit is complete!

An emagged ED-209 fires deadly lasers AND attacks anyone on sight.

## Drone

A disposable little drone that runs around and repairs things. Controlled by players, and can't interact with any other beings at all (besides other drones). Usually good to make lots of these to let ghosts get back into the round.

- Drone Shell Build a drone shell from the Exosuit Fabricator.

That's it! Any ghost can click on the drone shell to take control of it and start repairing the station. 

## Vim

Minature little mecha for sentient small animals, such as pets, to ride around in. Comes with headlights, and the ability to chime or buzz (in case you can't speak galactic common).

Non-sentient animals cannot pilot it.

To manufacture:
1 x EVA Helmet
2 x Borg Leg (left or right)
1 x Flashlight
1 x Screwdriver
1 x Voice Analyzer

    Attach two Borg Legs to your EVA Helmet.
    Attach a flashlight to the Vim assembly.
    Use a screwdriver to attach the flashlight.
    Use a Pen to name it if you wish.
    Attach the Voice Analyzer to the assembly.

Your mini mech is now ready for Ian to take a joyride in!
