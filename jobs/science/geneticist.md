You start in Genetics and get to work on people's genes. The main thing you're meant to do is to find superpowers and sell give them to the appropriate people, such as the Heads of Staff, the Security and the Engineers.

Bare minimum requirements: Don't give away Hulk to the greytide.
Base skills: Know whether a given mutation should be disabled as soon as it comes up, stay hidden on a disk, or be distributed and to whom.

Advanced skills: Know how to handle viruses to safely create and use CRISPR charges, and for when the monkeys inevitably get sick. Know how to efficiently use chromosomes, and to have Hulk and Fire Breath injectors ready before a malf blow your consoles up or xenos invade your lab. 

The genetics lab is located in Science. 

# Genetic Research

Your main job is to manipulate the DNA of humanoids to discover useful gene mutations. What you choose to use the results for is up to you, but the Research Director and the Tide are likely to come asking for mutations.

In practice, you will mainly recreate DNA pairs of As and Ts, and of Cs and Gs, guess when both elements of a pair are missing, use the Gene scanner.gif genetic sequence analyzer, or use the Joker (or wait for its 20 min cooldown to finally end). Left-clicking to roll forward, right-clicking to roll backward.


You will gradually unlock beneficial and negative mutations, and get a large choice of mutations you can gift or sell. For example:

- Telekinesis to help Engineers and Atmos. Techs, and Cargo do their heavy lifting (canisters and crates) and use computers despite their insuls and H.A.U.L. gauntlets.
- Insulated to Engineers, so they can swap their chunky insuls for fire-retardant black gloves
        Security would also benefits from Insulated when if the silicons eventually go rogue.
        Additionally, other Science staff members could assist the engineers with broken cables, or give back the insuls they took in Tech Storage.
- Mind Reader and Transcendent Olfaction could help the Detective in an investigation.
- Pig Latin if you want to bully the Curator.
- Glowy to offer some degree of protection against Nightmares, feed Podpeople, or bully Shadowpeople.
- Then there is Space Ada Temperature Adaptation and Pressure Adaptation. Expect a lot of people to come only for those two.
- Hulk is also extremely useful, and as dangerous. You should print a few injectors, store the mutation on disk, delete it from the computer, and give both the injectors and the disk to Security or the RD for safekeeping.
- If things are bad, then you may consider Internal Martyrdom for those ready to die/sacrifice themselves fighting NukeOps or the Malf's borgs. Be sure to have the consent of your patients, or the approval of at least one Head (arguably, only the Head with the right to call executions' should count — either the Captain or the HoS).
- You could also use Fire breath's incendiary power to take down filthy Xenomorphs.
- Some people enjoy the benefits of Gigantism and Dwarfism, as well.
- If you're unlucky (or lucky?), you may even have that guy as a client — the Burdened God worshipper, asking for more and more of those sweet disabilities you are discovering.

Another feature of the DNA scanners is to extract identities from DNA ("Enzymes"). You can then usurp someone else's identity and looks, or allow someone else to. You may also save the Captain's if they need to perform undercover missions or to hide.

See the Guide to Genetics for a detailed guide about how it works. 

# Tips

- If someone has a cavity implanted item, you can instantly remove it by monkeying them.
- Monkeying someone who is impregnated with a Alien Larva will cure them.
- HARSing a zombie will remove the tumor from their head, curing them!
- The Genetics DNA altering console can spit out injectors UE and UI. This means that if you get a willing volunteer, or even just human a monkey, you can run around the station changing everyone into the same person (if you do this without being antag or having people’s consent, you may get banned).
- Radiation (and mutagen) has a very, VERY small chance to give non-negative effects.
- If the mime's being a jackass, stealthily inject them with a Tourette's injector, and watch them get lynched for breaking their vow.
- Telekinesis allows you to keep the scanner's interface open if you put yourself (or get put) in the scanner; helpful to hide, get out, or tweak your own gene pool/identity.
- If you can handle the toxin damage, monkeys can transform into gorillas (25% chance per second) once they have over 2500 genetic damage.
- Gorillas are however extremely dangerous: they're immune to stuns, shoves, wounds, mutations, viruses. They cannot destroy reinforced walls like Hulks, but they certainly resist those punnies' attacks much better.
- And while sentient gorillas should still be crew-side (unless either/both of you are antags), non-sentient gorillas are hostile, they aggro until they kill, and they like to amputate limbs from unconscious or hard crit carbons and bodies. Do not make non-sentient gorillas if you're crew-side; it won't be solved as easily as the Chemist's Life and the Xenobiologist's gold extracts accidents.

DO NOT USE MONKEY INJECTORS ON NON-ANTAG CREW MEMBERS IF YOU ARE NOT AN ANTAG YOURSELF. THIS WILL GET YOU BANNED. UNLESS YOU ARE USING IT FOR HELPFUL PURPOSES.

Antag tips

- Advanced injectors are a hell of a weapon — you just happen to have an Injector gun available in the traitor uplink.
- Change your identity if you're caught being a griffer. Keeps people off of you.
- Telekinesis is a useful mutation. With it you can:
- Bash people with items. If they pick the item up, you can still hit them with it.
- Steal items across desks
- Operate basic machinery
- Be an all-around douchebag while you stay in the relative safety of a locker in maint.
- You can take bodies to your lab and steal their identities.
- Lings can use the DNA sting on the monkeys and the monkeymen, making this objective free-win.
- Monkeys are able to steal items from people's hands, and so would you, if monkified.
- Alternatively: Gorillas. Immune to stuns, chems, viruses, wounds, and mutations. Non-sentient gorilla are extremely aggressive, hitting until the target is dead, are likely to dismember anyone unable to move (unconscious, hard crit, or dead). Guess which traitor gets the chance to transform into one and to spawn non-sentient ones. You may also transform monkeys into gorillas
