## Description 
Engineering is single handedly the most crucial department to the stations function as it contains the ability to breath and use machines that were created after the 19th century. As such the engineering department is staffed with the ~~most psychotic~~ best Nanotrassen will pay for.


## The Rooms
This is going over the rooms inside of importance to an engineers daily life aboard the station.
### ![supermatter_shard.png](/jobs/engineering/supermatter_shard.png) The Engines
The main power plant of your station, Usually behind multiple reinforced walls and covered in cameras these engines will be the bread and butter of what you do, but can destroy the station more then any toxins bomb could.
### ![lathe_singular2.png](/jobs/engineering/lathe_singular2.png) Engineering lobby
Engineering lobby is the main entrance to both atmospherics and greater engineering, it commonly hosts the engineering protolathe and the circuit printer, protect those two machines as they are your key to doing medium to high level repairs across the station.
The engineering security post is stationed here.
### ![field_generator.gif](/jobs/engineering/field_generator.gif) Secure storage
This room is behind blast doors that can only be opened with CE access (or turn off the power and crowbar) It usually contains spare field generators, emitters, and a plasma canister.
### ![multitool.png](/jobs/engineering/multitool.png) Tech storage
Tech storage contains a horde of pre printed boards of which many require technology to print more of, besides the boards and electrical supplies, there is a reinforced room inside containing high value boards such as communications and AI uploads.
### ![gravity_generator.png](/jobs/engineering/gravity_generator.png) Gravity Generator
Gravity Generator (Grav gen) is how the station keeps feet on the floor without the use of magboots, the area is secured with reinforced walls and as an internal SMES to keep itself powered. It takes a bit to recharge once it dies.
