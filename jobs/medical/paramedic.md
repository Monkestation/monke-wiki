| \[ job_image ]<br>Paramedic | Access: Medbay, Morgue, Maintenance, Hydroponics, Most department lobbies, Mineral Storage<br>Additional Access: Surgery<br>Difficulty: Easy<br>Supervisors: Chief Medical Officer<br>Duties: Run around the station looking for patients, respond to emergencies, give patients a roller bed ride to medbay<br>Guides:<br>Alternate Titles: Emergency Medican Technician, Search and Rescue Technician|

You are essentially a rescue medic. You spend most of your time outside medbay and therefore have reduced access. However you have increased access to the rest of the station.

You spawn with a Medical Belt full of stuff, a collapsed Roller Bed and a handheld crew monitor. As well, you start with the Lifeline app installed to your PDA which can track people!
You will most likely want to get the Handheld Crew Monitor from your belt, a Crew Pinpointer from one of the NanoMed Plus vending machines, a Health Scanner HUD and a Health Analyzer. After gearing up, go patrol the station looking for patients.

Bare minimum requirements: Find and bring injured crew members to Medbay so they can be treated by the doctors.
Basic skills: Enforce suit sensors, perform first aid, inject corpses with formaldehyde to prevent organ decay, don't drag bleeding people over the halls.
Advanced skills: Be able to do deal with all kinds of damage on the spot, know how to use a defibrillator, be efficient at healing more with less, rescue people from faraway places. 

# Medbay to bar, quick!

When you are a Paramedic, your job is to rescue people, take them to medbay, and leave them to be treated there. You can also perform first aid, diagnosing injuries and diseases with the help of a health analyzer, printable from the medical techfab, or even your PDA.
Most of the times, your Handheld Crew Monitor will tell you enough. At least as long as people have their suit sensors on. Keep the monitor screen on and put it in your pocket or jacket slot, it's extremely useful. When someone shows up as damaged, find them with your pinpointer and either suggest them to go to medbay or take them there.
The job is very simple. Find and transport people safely to medbay. But even that can prove challenging under certain hostile scenarios, so be prepared.

# Medical Storage

The main reason you'll come into this room is to grab one of the MedGlasses.png Health Scanners on the table. These totally not anime inspired eyewear pieces let you see people's healthbars over their head. Not only is this useful for finding critical patients quickly in a crowd, but the red cross next to their healthbar will change to a sickly face if they're infected with a virus, or a purple xenomorph if they're infected with an alien larva. Chemists, Geneticists and many others will sometimes want these, too.

You might want to also buy a better pinpointer from the NanoMed Plus and a Health Scanner. You can find biosuits for when the virologist fucks up. There are also spare first-aid kits that are very disputed, so try to be mindful when you take them and perhaps even warn your boss. 

# Advanced Paramedic Work

Giving drunk bar patrons roller bed rides not your style? Want to be a hero? Well, you probably won't, but you certainly can do more.
Never forget that you have Maintenance access for a reason: You are expected to retrieve lost bodies. Engineering blew up again? Get your spacesuit and bring the boys back home so they can fix their own mess. Space man HoP forgot to refill his oxygen tank? Off you go. In some cases, you can even go in your own little lavaland adventure to retrieve a miner's corpse.
With you around, nobody has to stay dead!

## The emergency utility belt

Once you get used to standard medical procedures, you can ask the doctors for their starting SMed.png medkit. It and one or two chems in your bag should be more than ideal.
If the doctors are stingy, robotics often has spare medkits and boxes can hold some surgical tools

- Sutures. In all basic medkits and extremely cheap to heal brute damage. Get faster as you get experience.
- Regenerative mesh.png Regenerative mesh. In all basic medkits and extremely cheap to heal burn damage. Get faster as you get experience.
- Basic surgery tools. While you could technically perform surgery, this is a work better left for doctors. Have a set of basic tools (Drapes, Scalpel, Hemostat and Cautery) to treat wounds like severe burns.
- Hercuri Spray. Cools down temperature and treats burns slowly. Expendable and abundant, but basically freezes the patient. Tell them to get coffee after. Spray away the tide when they fail their hacks and ask for help. Don't spray lizards, as they are cold blooded!
- Chem patches, syringes, gels and sprays. These allow you to heal damage a lot faster, but the ones found in the NanoMed and in medkits are usually limited. Libital, Aiuri and Syriniver are good examples of cheap useful chems, even though they have side effects.
- Medipens. Exceptional for healing a lot of damage very quick and efficiently, but scarce. Save for emergencies or leave them there. Salicyclic Acid, Oxandrolone and Pentetic Acid can all be found in their specific medkits.

## Clear!

If a patient has died recently, you may be able to use the defibrillator to revive them on the spot. The defibrillator can be found in Medical Doctor lockers (plus a more portable version in the CMO's locker or medical techfab after some research is done).

To use a normal bulky defibrillator, take off your backpack or satchel, put the defib on your back and click it, get your other hand free and activate the paddles to wield them in both hands, then click on the patient while targeting their chest. If the patient is wearing a thick suit like a space suit or firesuit you need to strip it off as well. STOP DRAGGING the patient, if you are, to prevent yourself from being shocked as well.

In order to successfully resuscitate a patient, several criteria must be met:


1. The patient must not have over 180 brute or burn damage; 179 brute and 179 burn is fine, just not 180 of one type. Reduce their damage below 180, and you can try again.

2. The patient must not be a suicide victim.

3. The patient must not be catatonic.

4. The patient must be in their body (they will get a message when they begin being defibrillated).

5. The patient must have a functioning heart. Plasmamen do not have hearts, for example. If the heart is decayed, it needs to be replaced or repaired.

If all these factors are met, then the patient will come back to life! However, this doesn't mean they can just get right back up. Instead, they'll likely still be deep in critical condition, as a successful revival only removes a bit of each damage type. They must quickly receive medical attention if you want to keep them alive. Make sure to use a health analyzer or your PDA to check how they died; if they have harmful chemicals in their body, they most likely still do (chemicals remain in bodies after death, but do not metabolize).

## Paramedic Equipment

Medbay has quite the collection of tools and chemicals to make your job easier (or harder). Some deserve the mention, others are situational.

Here is a list of stuff that either Paramedics spawn with, or are available in medbay:

- Compact Defibrillator. The only way to defib on the go. Needs research or a lot of begging to the CMO. With some research, MODsuits can come with an internal defib
- Crew Pinpointers. Starting with the Lifeline app on your tablet, you may also print physical ones using research or purchased from the Nanomed machine.
- Medical MODsuit. Medbay storage can start with a MODsuit, useful for emergency rescues in low pressure or cold environment.
- Handheld Crew Monitors. Arguably the most useful item you can hope to have. Using the information from suit sensors, it will give you all you need to know anywhere. Allows you to chill by the bar without much care.
- Health Analyzers. Allow you to check someone's condition further than the Crew Monitor, showing diseases, traumas and chemicals in their blood (Right click to check chems). An advanced version can be researched and printed at the medical techfab.
- Health Scanners. Immediate visual information for any living mob in your field of view. Not as robust as a proper Health Analyzer, but will help you quickly identify problems on passersby. A night vision upgrade is researchable, and some MODsuits have these built in.
- Medical Belt. Extremely useful, as it can hold most relevant tools and medicine. Can also hold cigarettes and lighters. The one you spawn with has a Handheld Crew Monitor and some less important medicine that you can right click to check their use.
- Nitrile Gloves. Keep your fingerprints to yourself. The Detective will thank you for keeping those on. They also increase the speed you inject people with syringes!
- Roller Beds. Dragging bleeding people will make them bleed even more, as well as making you slower. These are often helpful and sometimes vital. Also fun and collapsible. After they're researched, you can also print bluespace bodybags for easier carrying.

# Tips

- The bar has several drinks that help top off damage. Cream for brute, Lime Juice for toxin, Orange Juice for oxygen, Tomato Juice for burn, Blood Mary for blood and more.
- Raw carrots heal eye damage.
- Star-Kist is just cola with orange juice. This means that it will metabolize a bit faster and can be used as a poor man's medicine to speed up CPR.
- Wearing earmuffs will heal ear damage.
- Wearing a blindfold will heal eye damage.
- People with MODsuits activated or EVA suits worn cannot be defibbed.
- If you're not sure if someone's damage is too much, you can PDA them to ask if they need medical assistance.
- Even as a non-antag, try to carry a box of tools with you to hack when needed and to crowbar open doors. Extra access can also work to this effect.
- When needed, ask your patients for their epipen. You could also take it while they are down. It's safer to have yours saved for an emergency.
- Miner's Salve can be made with a twinkie, plasma sheet and iron sheet in a grinder. Make sure to apply it to skin!
- Don't forget to check the NanoMed for Libital and Aiuri gel. They are very very good. Do note, however, that these are diluted with Granibitaluri and heal better when there is less than 50 physical damage
- Chemisty is your best friend! Asking for a patch of some powerful healing medicines can mean you barely need to go medbay!

## Tips for Traitoring

- A stethoscope can be used to break into the safe.
- You can replace the cryoxadone with acid, so instead of healing people cryo will melt them to death.
- Syringe gun is one of the most lethal weapons on the station. A simple 15 unit lexorin syringe will kill unless the victim receives medical care (or immediately injects themselves with their Epinephrine). Anyone with a thick suit will block syringes though.
- Carry a body in your roller bed and you won't get questioned too often. Use maintenance for safety.
