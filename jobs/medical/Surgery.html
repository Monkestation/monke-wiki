<h1 class="toc-header" id="surgery"> Surgery</h1>
<p>All surgery requires a set of medical tools, typically found in the [[Operating Theatre]], along with an operating table.</p>
<h3 class="toc-header" id="surgical-tools"> = Surgical Tools =</h3>
<p>[[Medical_items#Surgical_Tools|Information about most tools used in surgery can be found here.]]</p>
<h3 class="toc-header" id="surgery-speed-and-failure"> = Surgery Speed and Failure =</h3>
<p>For every tool there are ''ghetto analogues''. The percentages listed next to them show how efficient they are '''speed wise''' compared to the basic tools (on TG the percentages used to simply mean ''success rate'' until Oct 2019). For example, if it says "50%" the step takes double the time to complete. These percentages stack with the percentage point bonus or malus from using different tables or chemicals.</p>
<p>However, the slowness is capped to 2x the original time the step would have taken. A step that takes 10 seconds would cap at 20 seconds, for example. Every second after that cap will instead add 1 percentage point into the odds of a failure. Failing may cause extra damage or other effects.</p>
<p>So for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Say a surgery step takes 10 seconds by default, but you use a pen (25%) instead of a hemostat and do it on the floor (50%) instead of a surgery table.</li>
<li>Now the surgery is slowed to 40 seconds, but since it's capped at 20 seconds it takes 20 seconds.</li>
<li>Those 20 extra seconds that were removed when we capped it to 20 seconds is now your chance to fail.</li>
<li>Result: The step takes 20 seconds and has a 20% chance to fail.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="toc-header" id="beginning-of-any-operation"> Beginning of any Operation</h2>
<p>Step 1: Undress the part of the patient that needs surgery. You can do this by dragging them onto yourself, and then clicking the clothes you want to remove from them in the pop-up.</p>
<ul>
<li>'''Important:''' The uniform the patient is wearing usually covers both legs, arms, groin and torso. Helmets, eyewear and masks always obscure the eyes, make sure to remove them if working on the eyes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 2: <img alt="OpTable.gif" src="/OpTable.gif"> Place the patient onto the <strong>operating table</strong>. Do this doing a <img alt="24px-grab_action.png" src="/24px-grab_action.png"><img alt="Grab_32.png" src="/Grab_32.png"> on the patient. Then left click the operating table to place the patient on it. You can also <img alt="24px-rightclick.png" src="/24px-rightclick.png"> shove a person onto the table and tell them to rest, though they might not appreciate this.</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is no operating table, you can use a "stasis bed" (-10%), "any table" (-20%), "any bed" (-30%), ask them to lie "on the floor" (-50%). The = Surgery Speed and Failure = of completing every step will be reduced.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 2.1 <img alt="longislandicedtea.png" src="/longislandicedtea.png"> (Optional) Splash on, spray or apply a patch with "<strong>Miner's Salve</strong>" (+10%), "<strong>Sterilizine</strong>" (+20%), "<strong>alcoholic drinks</strong>" (up to +46%), or "Honey" (+60%) for faster surgery speed.</p>
<p><em>The stronger the alcohol, the more effective! The formula is: 0.1</em>(booze power/65). For example: Ethanol gives +10% surgery speed, Manly Dorf +15%, Bacchus' Blessing +46%.</p>
<p>Step 2.2: <img alt="n2otank.png" src="/n2otank.png"> (Optional) Use a '''tank of anesthetic''' and a '''breath mask''' to make your patient sleep. This way patient won't experience agonizing pain, decreasing its <strong>mood</strong>.</p>
<p>Step 3: <img alt="drapes.png" src="/drapes.png"> Place '''drapes''' or '''bedsheet''' over the part of body you are operating.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you done step 1 wrong, it will tell you that you must remove clothing first. If you continue without fixing, you will stab your patient instead of doing surgery.</li>
</ul>
<p v-pre="true">Step 4: Turn off {{Combat_Mode}}. Pro tip: {{Rightclick}} will make you fail every surgery step on purpose.</p>
<p>Step 5: [[File:Hud-target.gif|Target]] '''Aim''' at the appropriate body part (important!).</p>
<p v-pre="true">Step 6: {{LeftclickCmodeoff}} [[File:Scalpel.png|Scalpel]] '''Do the surgery''' (see the steps below!). Afterwards congratulate the patient and kick them out. Failed steps will autorepeat.</p>

<h2 class="toc-header" id="organ-manipulation"> Organ Manipulation</h2>
<p>This surgery covers operations to remove/insert organs (brain, heart, appendix), cyber implants and alien embryos.<br>
The body part to target depends on which procedure you want to do.</p>
<p>See below for details about each procedure.<br>
|-<br>
|Step 1: <img alt="drapes.png" src="/drapes.png"> <strong>Scalpel</strong>: make an incision.<br>

<h3 class="toc-header" id="ordinary-organs-that-require-organ-manipulation"> Ordinary organs that require Organ Manipulation</h3>
<p>These organs are present in every normal human, and can be removed or transferred through the <strong>Organ Manipulation</strong> surgery type.</p>
<h4 class="toc-header" id="brain"> Brain <img alt="drapes.png" src="/drapes.png"> <img alt="drapes.png" src="/drapes.png"></h4>
<p>The source of consciousness, and where the player actually resides. Removing the brain from a body will make it unrevivable through normal means. The brain can also be inserted into an <strong>MMI</strong> to allow it to speak, and to prepare it to be inserted into a <strong>Cyborg</strong> or an <strong>AI</strong>. Or it can be transferred into another body, which can then be <strong>revived</strong>.</p>
<p>Changelings' brains are vestigial, and they can survive without them. Beheading a changeling will not prevent one from reviving.</p>
<p><img alt="drapes.png" src="/drapes.png"> <strong>Target: Head</strong><br>
<strong>Note:</strong> Brains can also be removed by beheading the target and using a sharp object on the head to extract the brain.</p>
<h4 class="toc-header" id="heart"> Heart <img alt="drapes.png" src="/drapes.png"> ====</h4>
<p>Required for basic survival, removing it will cause a heart attack, dealing huge amounts of oxygen damage until a new, beating, heart is inserted, or death. This can be delayed with [[epinephrine]], if you need more time. This will not keep someone conscious, but will make them suffocate slower.</p>
<p>On their own, hearts only beat for a short time when removed from a living body. To get a heart beating again, click on it while it's in your hand.</p>
<p>Heart attacks can also be induced by [[Initropidril]], and a heart attack may continue if you insert a still heart in a patient. In either case, to restore the heart to normal functionality, the patient needs to either be defibrillated or receive an electric shock.</p>
<p>[[File:Hud_target_chest.gif]] '''Target: Chest'''</p>
<p>==== Eyes [[File:Eyes.png]] ====</p>
<p>They're required for sight. Removing them will, obviously, turn the patient blind. Some races' eyes can see in the dark.</p>
<p>[[File:Hud_target_eyes.gif]] '''Target: Eyes'''</p>
<p>==== Ears[[File:Ears.png]] ====</p>
<p>Required for hearing. Removing them will make the patient deaf.</p>
<p>[[File:Hud_target_head.gif]] '''Target: Head'''</p>
<p>==== Liver [[File:Liver_organ.png]] ====</p>
<p>Required for processing [[Guide_to_chemistry|reagents]]. Removing the liver will cause the patient to take heavy toxin damage. Some starting jobs give you a liver with special benefits.</p>
<p>[[File:Hud_target_chest.gif]] '''Target: Chest'''</p>
<p>==== Lungs [[File:Lungs.png]] ====</p>
<p>Required for breathing. Removing the lungs will cause the patient to suffocate, regardless of air or internals. Some [[Guide_to_races|species]] have mutant lungs that don't need air: transplanting them onto an breathing race will transfer this property.</p>
<p>[[File:Hud_target_chest.gif]] '''Target: Chest'''</p>
<p>==== Stomach [[File:Stomach_organ.png]] ====</p>
<p>Required for eating and drinking.</p>
<p>[[File:Hud_target_chest.gif]] '''Target: Chest'''</p>
<p>==== Tongue [[File:Tongue.png]] [[File:Ltongue.png]] ====</p>
<p>Affects speech. Lacking a tongue will make speech very hard to comprehend, while mutant tongues such as lizards' or flypeoples' will give the patient the race's speech quirks. [[Abductor]]s' tongues carry over their telepathy, but they prevent normal speech.</p>
<p>[[File:Hud_target_mouth.gif]] '''Target: Mouth'''</p>
<p>==== Appendix [[File:Appendix.png|Appendix]][[File:Appendix_inflamed.png|Inflamed appendix]] ====</p>
<p>Removing it cures appendicitis and prevents it in the future too, it is not required for survival so don't go worrying about that.</p>
<p>[[File:Hud_target_crotch.gif]] '''Target: Groin'''</p>
<p>=== Other organs that require Organ Manipulation ===<br>
There are also non-natural organs which can be added to give bonuses or to harm the patient in a few cases.</p>
<p>==== Cybernetic Implants [[File:Chest_implant.png]][[File:Brain_implant.png]][[File:Eye_implant.png]][[File:Toolset_arm_implant.png]] ====</p>
<p>These offer benefits to the patient at the cost of being very vulnerable to EMPs, with malfunctions ranging from eye-flashing to heart attacks. Cybernetic implants always require the [[#Organ_Manipulation|Organ Manipulation]] type surgery, even for arms. Cybernetic implants can be printed by [[Robotics]] or the [[medbay]] techfab after research.</p>
<p>[[File:Hud_target_chest.gif]][[File:Hud_target_head.gif]][[File:Hud_target_eyes.gif]] '''Target: Chest/Head/Eyes/Arms'''</p>
<p>==== Cybernetic Organs [[File:Cybernetic_heart.gif]] [[File:Cybernetic_liver.png]] [[File:Cybernetic_lungs.png]] [[File:Robotic_eyes.png]] ====</p>
<p>Cybernetic organs replace organs entirely. You need to remove the corresponding organ first to make room for the cybernetic organ. They are vulnerable to EMPs, do not decay, and do not heal over time. Cybernetic organs can be printed by [[Robotics]] or the [[medbay]] techfab after research.</p>
<p>[[File:Hud_target_chest.gif]][[File:Hud_target_eyes.gif]] '''Target: Chest/Eyes'''</p>
<p>==== Xenomorph Embryo [[File:Facehugger.png|Facehugger]][[File:Larva.png|Larva]] ====</p>
<p>An alien larva growing inside the patient. If not removed quickly enough, it will gib the patient and try to escape, growing into a dangerous [[Xenomorph]].</p>
<p>[[File:Hud_target_chest.gif]] '''Target: Chest'''</p>
<p>==== Romerol Tumor ====</p>
<p>A latent infection in the patient's head, caused by [[Syndicate Items#Romerol|Romerol]]. If the patient dies while affected by Romerol, he will eventually rise as an aggressive [[Guide to races#Romerol Zombie|Zombie]]. This will repeat as long as the infection lasts; removing it surgically, cutting the head off, or gibbing the corpse will prevent resurrection.</p>
<p>Romerol is infective, and anyone hit by a zombie while unprotected will also acquire a Romerol Tumor.</p>

== Feature Manipulation==<br>
This surgery covers operations to remove/insert external organs. External organs include lizard horns, frills, tails, snouts, moth antennae and wings, podperson hair and more. If you want to haunt someones dreams, this is the surgery for you.</p>
<p>Functions and mechanics associated with an external organ will be transferred aswell. Give your patient moth wings and they will be able to fly like a moth.</p>
<p>The body part to target depends on which external organs you want to add/remove. Tails are in the groin, while spines and wings are in the chest.</p>

<p>== Lobectomy ==<br>
This surgery is an extended organ manipulation, cutting open the chest cavity and removing a disfunctional lobe within the [[Guide_to_medicine#Organ_damage|lungs]]. This restores health to the [[Guide_to_medicine#Organ_damage|lungs]], and makes them operable, if they weren't before. Be warned, however, that this surgery can only be done once per set of lungs. Can only be performed if the patient's lungs are above 60 damage, which is a tad past severe damage thresholds. Do NOT confuse this surgery with lobotomy!</p>

This surgery is an extended organ manipulation, cutting open the chest cavity and grafting a bypass onto the patient's [[Guide_to_medicine#Organ_damage|heart]]. This restores health to the heart, and makes it operable, if it was not before. Be warned, however, that this surgery can only be done once per heart, and that incising the heart and attaching the graft are not guaranteed successes. Keep bandages on hand in the event of failing the step, which will result in massive amounts of bleeding. Can only be performed if the heart has more than 60 damage (tad past severe damage threshold).</p>

<p>=Upgradable Surgery=<br>
These surgeries are available roundstart but can be upgraded to better or different versions by researching certain nodes and then syncing a connected operating computer.</p>
<p>==Tend Wounds==<br>
The tend wounds surgeries all share the same steps. They can be upgraded by researching certain nodes, and then syncing the operating computer with research database. There are "bruises", "burn" and "Mixture" versions. By default only "bruises" and "burn" are available. The basic versions of this surgery can be performed anywhere, but the upgraded versions require an operating table with an adjacent and synced operating computer. <br></p>
<p>The target is healed by this surgery, without any [[Guide_to_chemistry|chemicals]] being involved. Useful for healing dead bodies for [[#Revival|revival]]. This works on patients with clothes on, but it's only 55% as effective. <br></p>
<p>[[File:Hud_target_chest.gif]] '''Target: Chest'''<br>
{|<br>
| style="width: 400px;" |'''Procedure'''||'''Ghetto Analogues'''<br>
|-<br>
|Step 1: [[File:Scalpel.png|Scalpel]] '''Scalpel''': make a careful incision (does not cause damage or bleeding).||[[File:Knife.png|Kitchen Knife]] (65%) [[File:Shard.png|Shard]] (45%) [[File:Sword.gif|Energy Sword]] (75%) Any other sharp item (30%)<br>
|-<br>
|Step 2: [[File:Hemostat.png|Hemostat]] '''Hemostat''': repair damage to the target (automatically repeats until fully healed).||[[File:Screwdriver_tool.png|Screwdriver]] (65%) [[File:Pen.png|Pen]] (55%)<br>
|-<br>
|Step 3: [[File:Cautery.png|Cautery]] '''Cautery''': seal the wound.||[[File:Laser_gun.png|Laser]] (90%) [[File:Welder.png|Welder]] (70%) [[File:Lighter.png|Lighter]] (45%) [[File:Match.png|Match]] (20%)<br>
|}</p>
<p>*Step 2 will heal at least 5 damage each time it's repeated, with an added bonus the more damaged the patient is. This the bonus healing becomes higher with higher tiers of research, ranging from (patient's damage / 75) to (patient's damage / 12.5). The bonus is much lower on dead patients.<br>
*Without any research the heal is 5 damage plus a bonus from damage. ("bruises" and "burn" versions only).<br>
*With '''Improved Wound-Tending Surgery''' researched and synced, it will heal 5 damage plus a higher bonus from damage ("bruises" and "burn" versions only).<br>
*With '''Advanced Surgery''' researched and synced, it will heal 5 damage plus an even higher bonus from damage ("bruises" and "burn" versions only).<br>
*With '''Advanced Surgery''' researched and synced, you'll be able to do the "mixture" version (tend physical wounds), which heals 3 brute and burn plus a bonus from damage, but the step takes much shorter time than the other two versions.<br>
*With '''Experimental Surgery''' researched and synced, "tend physical wounds" will heal 3 brute and burn plus a better bonus from damage.<br>
*With '''Alien Surgery''' researched and synced, "tend physical wounds" will heal 1 brute and burn plus a very high bonus from damage.<br>
*Failing the hemostat step [[File:Hemostat.png|Hemostat]] will deal some of the damage it would have healed.<br>
*You can hold a [[File:Health_analyzer.gif|Health Analyzer]] '''Health Analyzer''' in your other hand to see your patient's remaining wounds while treating them.</p>
<p>If research was completed in the middle of surgery, you must restart the surgery to get the upgraded version.</p>
<p>= Advanced Surgery =<br>
These surgeries require the '''Advanced Surgery''' research node. After it is researched you must sync an operating computer (click "View Surgery Procedures" and then "Sync with research database") to unlock the procedures. Advanced surgeries can only be performed on an operating table with a connected operating computer.</p>

<p>== Viral Bonding ==</p>
<p>The target is forced into a symbiotic relationship with a virus. It makes the virus stay at stage 1 where it's usually harmless, but still infective to others .<br> Note: The target must already be infected before you can initiate this surgery with the drapes. The target must be dosed with at least 5 units of [[Guide to chemistry#Virus Food|Virus Food]], [[Guide to chemistry#Formaldehyde|Formaldehyde]], and [[Guide to chemistry#Spaceacillin|Spaceacillin]] for the "Viral Bond" step to work.

<p>= Alien Surgery =<br>
These surgeries require the '''Alien Surgery''' research node, which requires the '''Alien Technology''' node, which can only be revealed from deconstructing certain [[abductor]] items. After it is researched you must sync an operating computer (click "View Surgery Procedures" and then "Sync with research database") to unlock the procedures. Alien surgeries can only be performed on an operating table with a connected operating computer.</p>
<p>== Brainwashing ==</p>
<p>The target of this surgery, when successful, is bound to a primary goal you assign to him/her. He/she must follow these objectives, regardless of allegiance. This can be cured through brain surgery or with a mindshield implant. Requires either the brainwashing disk, acquired through the [[Syndicate Items#Brainwashing_Surgery_Program|Syndicate Uplink]], or researching the "Alien Surgery" technology.</p>
