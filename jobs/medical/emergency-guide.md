# Emergency Medical Guide
> You've come across some poor bastard that's bleeding out, you've hauled them off to Medical and there's no staff? You've pulled out the right page. Abbreviated what to do first, then a slight deeper discussion.
{.is-info}

#### Quick Actions

1) Check alive or dead, use EPI if they're in crit.
2) Haul patient to medical. Fireman carry (aggressive grab, then clickdrag to you), body bag, or roller bed. DO NOT DRAG ON FLOOR.
3) Put patient in **stasis bed**.
4) Get a **health analyzer**.
5) Run both health and chem scans. Take quick note.
6) Strip patient (click drag to you) of their jumper, treat both brute and burns using means available. Surgery if you know and have the tools immediately on hand, **sutures and regenerative mesh** if you don't.
7) If patient was gasping for air, attempt CPR if they need it. If dead on the table, go to *step 8*. If alive, *step 9*.
8) Get **DEFIB**, put into holder. Grab paddles, two hand the paddles, target chest, shock the patient.
9) If patient cannot revive due to **DEFIB** report of bad heart, also noted on **health analyzer**, acquire surgical tools and conduct emergency coronary bypass via *step 10*. If alive, ensure condition does not worsen after taking patient off stasis table.
10) **CORONARY BYPASS**: Drapes on Chest, Scalpel, Retractor, Circular Saw, Hemostat, Scalpel, Hemostat, Cautery. Once complete, reattempt defib.
11) Provided that the patient is stable and conditions are not deteriorating, your job is done. Have medical personnel handle things from here if you are not confident in your skills to conduct any remaining surgical interventions or first aid action.

#### Discussion of steps and why
1) First things first, obvious check. If they're still alive, they may be able to tell you what's wrong. The **epinepherine pen** in your survival box has both some epinepherine in it as well as some formaldehyde, which will prevent organ decay while it is present in the body. If the patient is dead, you especially want to use the pen so one can cover the possibility that there are no stasis bets available in the medbay.
2) You want to pick up and move the patient because dragging them on the floor, especially with significant brute damage, will greatly accelerate any active bleeds, especially in cases where they have suffered a lot of wounds, such as large punctures and cuts that have broken bones through the skin (compound fractures). Using a body bag bypasses the whole "dragging on the floor", and a roller bed is the most mobile option if one happens to be nearby.
3) Anyone placed in a stasis bed has all their biological functions suspended. This means that if they're in hard crit slowly dying, they will no longer take any further damage but be stuck in this state until action is taken to bring them out of crit. **This also suspends metabolizing of medicines in the body, so keep note if you need chems to work on someone after the fact.**
4) Acquire a HEALTH ANALYZER. You can fabricate one from the medical department protolathe or pull one out from the white and blue first aid kits that are typically in the public lobby as well as the storage room.
5) Analyze the patient using both LEFT CLICK and RIGHT CLICK to get both the INJURIES and CHEMS readouts. You want to know what all of the problems are and what is currently present. If there was, say a large spider attack, there is a good chance someone has lots of venom in their blood, which will absolutely require a blood filter procedure and possibly a Hepatectomy (liver fix surgery).
6) First, wounds. Strip the patient by dragging the patient to you, treat burns and brute using most comfortable means. If surgical tools aren't immediately available, use **SUTURES and REGENERATIVE MESHES** from the same first aid kit you pulled out. A combined total of greater than 200 damage across all four categories causes death. Damage values totaling 100-199 will leave one in crit, usually 140-150+ being hard crit. Values reduced by 25% for a Goblin as they have less total health, so take a lot less damage before death. We want to get those values down fast as possible in order to affect a DEFIB.
7) Second, look at OXY damage. If they having trouble breathing before, it's an indication they were in hard crit for some period of time. While they are on the table, remove your and their masks and conduct CPR to clear the OXY damage. **If the patient had died during transit, you won't be able to clear the OXY damage.** However, having epinepherine in the body will greatly reduce OXY damage when a DEFIB is conducted.
8) Simple operation of a DEFIB. A major skill all personnel should know and understand.
9) If patient revives, repeat step 7 to help clear any exising OXY damage. If patient has no further obvious issues, unbuckle from the stasis bed, provide CPR  If defib fails and reports an issue, reuse the HEALTH ANALYZER and see what issues still exist. If the heart has deteriorated completely, it will require a CORONARY BYPASS surgery to repair.
10) **CORONARY BYPASS**: Drapes on Chest, Scalpel, Retractor, Circular Saw, Hemostat, Scalpel, Hemostat, Cautery. Wear a pair of latex gloves to help keep your success rate high, as will doing it on a stasis table or operating table.
11) As long as the patient shows no further immediately deadly problems, your duty to your fellow crew is complete. Medical can handle the rest of the recovery of the patient and further required surgeries to bring them back to full health.
