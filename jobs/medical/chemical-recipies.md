"Hey mate, welcome to Chemistry. This is one of the few jobs where you can make a man heal back up to full health one second and make him explode the next. <br>
Sound too complicated? Naw, this stuff is really simple to make. All you have to do is pour some of this Potassium into a beaker of water, like so..."

# Active Pure Chemicals
A.K.A. what happens when you eat or splash these. Their metabolism rate is 0.4u per tick/cycle unless said otherwise. Unmentioned dispensable chemicals don't have any effects. Plasma and uranium require you to grind mineral sheets to acquire. 

- Chlorine: Causes 1 brute damage per tick to a random body part.
- Copper: Can be splashed on metal sheets to create bronze sheets.
- Ethanol: A decent alcoholic "beverage", with a booze power of 65. Increases the speed of surgery procedures and flammability when applied externally. Metabolism rate 0.2.
- Fluorine: Causes 1 toxin damage per tick.
- Iron: Slowly restores blood volume.
- Lithium: Causes twitching, drooling, moaning and not being able to walk straight.
- Mercury: Causes 1 brain damage per tick, twitching, drooling, moaning and not being able to walk straight.
- Plasma: Causes 3 toxin damage per tick. Creates gas form plasma when spilled or heated to 323.15K (50°C). Not to be confused with Stable Plasma, which does nothing.
- Radium: Causes 2 toxin damage per tick. Creates glowing green goo on floor if more than 3u is spilled.
- Sugar: Gives nutrition. Causes hyperglycemic shock if overdosed (120u). Metabolism rate 2.
- Sulfuric Acid: Causes 1 toxin damage and some instant brute damage to one body part when ingested, and slightly more brute damage when injected. Destroys head-wear and causes burn damage when sprayed or splashed on someone. Counts as a toxin.
- Uranium: Causes 1 toxin damage per tick. Creates glowing green goo on floor if more than 3u is spilled.
- Water: Slightly generates blood volume. Additionally, freezes into ice below 274K.
- Welding Fuel: Causes 1 toxin damage per tick. Makes people flammable if splashed on. If splashed on the floor, makes a pool of fuel that can be ignited, which can ignite other pools around it.

## Catalysts
When a reagent in a recipe is marked "(catalyst)" it means it will not be consumed in the reaction. Some Catalysts are optional and are highlighted as such. These optional catalysts affect the ongoing reaction in certain ways.

# Components
These are very basic chemicals that you'll use in a lot of other more complicated chems. They can still be toxic, though.

# Core Healing Medicines
These healing drugs may be considered to be cheap or commonly available "core" drugs, used to heal common ailments. Some of them should not be used repeatedly on the same patient, as they may have dangerous side effects.

# Superior Healing Medicines
These healing drugs are harder to make than the core healing medicines, however they often heal faster and with fewer side effects (if any). 

# Unique Healing Medicines
These healing drugs perform niche functions that help against less common ailments. 

# Non-craftable Medicines
These healing drugs are used in some situations, but are otherwise uncraftable. 

# Narcotics
Narcotics are highly addictive drugs that can aggressively, or passively, provide a benefit. Be wary as its very easy to become addicted, or overdose, on a narcotic.

As a general rule of thumb, the more of a positive effect (or any effect) a narcotic can provide, the easier it is to get addicted or overdose on it.

People who overdose or get addicted to Narcotics tend to usually end up dying to the negative effects or requiring immedient medical attention. Take in moderation. 

# Pyrotechnics
The manipulation of fire and matter. 

# Other Reagents
These are other chemicals that usually have non-medicinal uses. Many of these are useful in the manufacturing of grenades, but some can be quite dangerous. 

# ~~Virology Recipes~~
These chemicals are used to mutate viruses, and have few uses beyond that. 

# Mutation Toxins
Obtainable through xenobiology, these chemicals transform humanoids into other races. It only takes 1u to start the transformation.

# Lavaland Chemicals
Found primarily in Lavaland flora.

# Toxins
The deadliest of deadly chemicals. You can get some of these through the traitor uplink. The human liver will stop individual toxins from working if there are 3u or less of it in a body. The threshold for a toxin to work lowers with higher liver damage. Toxins deal liver damage. 

# Impure / Inverse / Failed Chemicals
These chemicals can only be created ~~from inoptimal reactions~~ with xenobio.

# Reagent Delivery
There are different ways you can apply chemicals to a person or the environment. 

**Delivery types**
There are 5 types of delivery, called ingest, inject, vapor, touch and patch. If you are not interested in the details, you can skip to Smoke vs Foam vs others.

## Ingest
Ingesting reagents puts them into the stomach. The individual reagents in the stomach will then be digested over time, which slowly moves them to the bloodstream at a rate partly based on the amount of them in the stomach, and stomach type (race). Most reagents have no effect until they have been moved to the bloodstream where they start metabolising (an exception is milk). They can be ejected if the person vomits. Ingestion is used by pills, cigarettes, e-cigarettes and drinking/eating the reagent directly. Inhaling smoke counts as ingesting, with the difference that smoke bypasses the stomach and is added directly to the bloodstream. Probital works best when ingested.

## Inject
On inject the reagent simply enters the target's bloodstream and starts metabolising. Reagents in blood can be filtered out using surgery. Used by syringes and IV-drips. Syriniver works best if injected.

## Vapor
Vapor is used by (ranged) spray bottles and foam. A portion of the reagents will enter the bloodstream of the target, depending on the overall bio protection the target's clothing offers. Any MODsuit typically makes the target completely immune to getting it into their bloodstream, if the helmet is closed. But if the reagent has a "vapor" based component, that component will still affect the target, like Fluorosulfuric Acid. See more about foam below, with examples. Hercuri works best as vapor.

## Touch
Touch is used by smoke and splashing. If the reagent has a "touch" based component, that component will affect the target (such as the instant heal part of Synthflesh), without being blocked by clothing. Nothing at all will enter the target's bloodstream, with the exception of smoke if the target has no internals on. Currently all "touch" components are also "patch" components. See more on smoke below, with examples.

## Patch
Patch is used by patches and medical gels. The reagent enters the target's bloodstream entirely AND if the reagent has a "patch" based component, that component will affect the target. Currently all "patch" components are also "touch" components. 

## Smoke vs foam vs others
These are the major practical differences between pills, syringes, patches, cigarettes, smoke, foam, splash and spray.

### Pills
Pills can be instantly ingested if used on yourself. It doesn't work if mouth is covered. Plasmamen will have trouble taking these. They hold up to 50u. Aren't added to bloodstream instantly.

### Syringes
Syringes can inject into people even with their mouths covered, either by hand or with a syringe gun. It doesn't work on players wearing MODsuits or other pierce-immune clothing, unless you use a piercing syringe or manage to aim for an exposed part of their body. Golems are completely immune to syringes (even piercing syringes), but patches do work on them. A syringe holds between 10-60u, depending on type. Common syringes hold 15u.

### Patches
Will add all reagents into a person's bloodstream through any clothing, including MODsuits. Also apply touch/patch based effects. Example: A patch of 20u Synthflesh will instantly heal 25 brute and burn (touch component), and also enter the target's bloodstream (which in this case does nothing). Usable by plasmamen. Can hold up to 40u.

### Cigarettes
Can be dipped in reagents to be filled. If smoking/vaping, you will slowly ingest whatever reagents the cigarette/cigar/e-cig contains. Though, if the reagents are too diluted, they may not build up in your bloodstream fast enough to have any effect at all. E-cigarettes can be trimmed with a screwdriver and multitool to also create smoke.

### Smoke
When a smoke reaction occurs, the smoke will consume any other reagent in its original containers, and spread that reagent to flooring and people/mobs who enter its area of effect. People who enter the smoke will be touched by the reagents. If they do not have internals or a gas mask on, they will also ingest the reagents. The amount of smoke does not dilute the reagents. The reagents will be copied to every individual or tile (not walls, windows or doors) over the cloud's duration. Reagents that are special coded to affect floor/environment (such as blood, acid or Space Cleaner) will do so. Smoke will usually block sight.

**Smoke example** 1: Smoke containing 20u Synthflesh. Everyone caught in the cloud, including people wearing MODsuits, will slowly heal 25 brute and burn (and take toxin damage), if they stay in the smoke for its full duration (otherwise they will heal partially). Those who are not wearing internals will also ingest 20u of the medicine, making it enter their bloodstream (which does nothing in this case).

**Smoke example** 2: Smoke containing 20u Chlorine Trifluoride(CLF3). CLF3 has a touch component, so everyone caught in the cloud, including people wearing MODsuit and internals, will catch on fire. It will also deal burn damage to the environment, since CLF3 is coded to do so. Those who are not wearing internals will also ingest 20u of the CLF3 and thus, start heating up from the inside, effectively burning from both in and out at the same time.

### Foam
When a foam reaction occurs, the foam will consume any other reagent in its original containers, and spread that reagent to flooring and people/mobs who enter its area of effect. The foam will spread slower than smoke and is usually slippery. Reagents will be copied through the vapor type delivery to those affected over the duration of the foam, BUT the reagents will be heavily diluted depending on the amount of foaming reagent used. Any clothing will reduce how much of the reagents will enter a person's bloodstream. Furthermore, foam reagent bloodstream insertion is divided into several 'ticks'. A minimum amount of reagent is required per tick for it to enter a bloodstream. So if too little reagents are contained in the reaction, or too much foam is used, the foam will do nothing. These ticks are counted after dilution and protection from clothing. On the other hand, if you use very small amounts of foam, the reagents may instead multiply in the bloodstream to more than the original amount. MODsuits with helmets on will make people immune to getting reagents into their bloodstream through foam. Despite dilution, the foam will still copy remaining chems such as acid, CLF3, or Space Cleaner to any tile it touches (but not walls, windows or doors). Foam will not block sight.

**Foam example** 1: 250u foam containing 10u Cyanide will spread a blue foam that does nothing to those it touches. The poison is too diluted to work at all.

**Foam example** 2: 20u foam containing 250u Fluorosulfuric Acid. A small area and everyone touched by the foam will have large amounts of acid slowly melting their clothing and the affected floor and items. Those who did not wear a MODsuit will also have a large amount of acid in their bloodstreams, depending on what they were wearing and how long they were in the foam. If they had internals on or not doesn't matter.

### Splashing
Throwing a beaker or using Rightclick.pngCombat 32.pngHarm 32.pngHelp 32.png on something while holding it will splash its contents. The longer throw distance, the more the splash will spread out. A grenade will splash its content unless it also contains smoke or foam. Splashing only does touch delivery. This means most chemicals will do absolutely nothing when splashed. Reagents that have special properties to affect environment, such as Water, will do so where splashed (creates slippery tile). Reagents that have a touch component will apply that component only. Example: If you throw a beaker of 80u Synthflesh at someone, you will instantly heal them for 100 brute and burn (and deal up to 150 toxin damage), since Synthflesh is touch/patch based. It doesn't matter if the target uses MODsuit or internals in this case. This means throwing a beaker of poison at someone will do nothing at all. Splashing can apply chemicals such as Thermite to walls.

### Spraying
Spraying reagents will apply them to environments (if they have any such effect), and will enter hit people's bloodstreams through the vapor delivery. This means clothing will protect from some/most/all of the reagents, depending on what they are wearing. Using a MODsuit with helmet on makes them immune to getting the reagent into their bloodstream. Reagents such as acid, CLF3, or Space Cleaner will still cause their special effects when sprayed on people/environments, but will not enter the bloodstream if the target is wearing too heavy clothing. 

# Beyond the Dispenser
Just because it isn't found in the dispenser or the guide above doesn't mean you can't use it! Drinks, slime cores and plenty of other things can provide limitless fun for an enterprising and curious chemist.
