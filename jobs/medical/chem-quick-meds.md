# Quick Meds Guide
You need meds fast. You want just something to read and follow instructions. Easy. This also includes some slightly less common recipes where you will be told what you need but we aren't giving a complete guide to make it (right now anyway).

All recipes are in 5u increments, given as ratios as you go. Depending on the beaker, you will have to juggle some beakers with the ChemMaster to hold onto extra stuff that you make. All recipes shown are done with a completely unupgraded dispenser. An upgrade one will have some things like Oil and Ammonia able to be made directly.

# Brute Meds
## Libital
- Welding Fuel, Carbon, Hydrogen (Oil) (15u)
- 3 Chlorine, 3 Water (Phenol) (45u)
- Nitrogen, Oxygen to make Libital. (135u total)

## Helbital
- Carbon, Fluorine, Sugar (15u)

## Probital
- Welding Fuel, Carbon, Hydrogen (Oil) (15u)
- Welding Fuel, Oxygen (Acetone) (45u)
- 2 Acetone, Copper, Phosphorus (88u Probital, leftover crap)

## Salicyclic Acid
- Welding Fuel, Carbon, Hydrogen (Oil) (15u)
- 3 Chlorine, 3 Water (Phenol) (45u)
- Sodium, Carbon, Oxygen, Sulfuric Acid (225u total)

# Burn Meds
## Aiuri
- 3 Hydrogen, Nitrogen (Ammonia) (15u)
- Ammonia, Sulfuric Acid, 2 Hydrogen (60u total)

## Lenturi
- 3 Hydrogen, Nitrogen (Ammonia) (15u)
- Ammonia, Silver, Sulfur, Oxygen, Chlorine (75u total)

## Hercuri
> Note: this is ONLY effective if put in a SPRAY BOTTLE, refill the existing ones in burn kits and keep the patient from going far as this will FREEZE them.
{.is-info}

- 2 Water, into reaction chamber set to 0 (makes 10.9 Ice)
- (Beaker 2) Iron, Oxygen, Hydrogen (15u Stabilizing Agent)
- Mix 10u Stabilizing Agent with 10u Plasma from grinding (1 sheet is 20u after grinding)
- Add Stable Plasma to Ice Beaker
- 2 Nitrogen (30u Cryostylane, 0.9 ice leftover)
- (Beaker 2) Sodium, Hydrogen, Oxygen (Lye), add to Beaker 1 (15u, 30u Cryo in beaker for 45)
- 3 Bromine, cool below 47K. (50u Hercuri with 5u ea Bromine and Lye left)

## Oxandrolone
- Welding Fuel, Carbon, Hydrogen (Oil) (15u)
- 3 Chlorine, 3 Water (Phenol) (45u)
- 3 Carbon, Phenol, Hydrogen, Oxygen (270u total Oxandrolone, you will need to empty beaker a few times)

# TOX Meds
## Multiver
- Sodium, Chloride, Water (Table Salt) (15u)
- Welding Fuel, Carbon, Hydrogen (Oil) (15u, 30 total)
- Heat past 480. (30u Multiver)

## Seiver
- Aluminium, Nitrogen, Potassium, ensure above 320k for 15u

## Syrinver
(note: this requires Toxin, which may be purchased at a chem vendor)
- 3 Hydrogen, Nitrogen (Ammonia) (15u)
- 2 Ammonia, Nitrogen, 2 Oxygen, heat to 525+ (Nitrous Oxide, makes 25u)
- Sulfur, Fluorine, Toxin, 2 Nitrous Oxide

## Higadrite
> Note: This stops toxin damage buildup from liver failure. Does not stop other sources of toxin damage
{.is-info}

- 2 Phenol, Lithium

# OXY Meds
## Tirimol
- Welding Fuel, Carbon, Hydrogen (Oil) (15u)
- Welding Fuel, Oxygen (Acetone) (45u)
- 2 Acetone, 3 Nitrogen, 1 Sulfuric Acid (catalyzer) (full acetone use nets 110u Tirimol)

## Convermol
- Welding Fuel, Carbon, Hydrogen (Oil) (15u)
- Oil, Fluorine, Hydrogen, heat to 370+ (45u Convermol)

## Salbutamol
- Make Salicyclic Acid above (Brute Meds)
- Salicyclic Acid, Lithium, Aluminium, Bromine, Ammonia

# ORGANFIX
## Mannitol (Weak Brainfix)
- Hydrogen, Water, Sugar (15u)

## Neurine (Strong Brainfix)
- Welding Fuel, Carbon, Hydrogen (Oil) (15u)
- Welding Fuel, Oxygen (Acetone) (45u)
- Acetone, Mannitol (see above), Oxygen.

## Oculine (Eyefix)
- Multiver (see above), Carbon, Hydrogen

## Inacusiate (Earfix)
- Multiver (see above), Carbon, Water

# OTHER STUFF

## Antihol (Alcohol purge)
- Multiver, Copper, Ethanol

## Epinepherine
> Note: There's usually quite a few bottles of the stuff lying around. BUT it doesn't hurt to know how to put this together if you somehow burn it all. You'll want at least 2 beakers for this unless you got BS beakers
{.is-warning}


- (Beaker 1) - Welding Fuel, Carbon, Hydrogen (Oil) (15u)
- Welding Fuel, Oxygen (Acetone) (45u)

## Formaldehyde (No Organ Rot)
- Ethanol, Oxygen, Silver, heat to 400K. (15u)
