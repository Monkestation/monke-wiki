# Quick Meds Guide
You need meds fast. You want just something to read and follow instructions. Easy. This also includes some slightly less common recipes where you will be told what you need but we aren't giving a complete guide to make it (right now anyway).

All recipes are in 5u increments, given as ratios as you go. Depending on the beaker, you will have to juggle some beakers with the ChemMaster to hold onto extra stuff that you make. All recipes shown are done with a completely unupgraded dispenser. An upgrade one will have some things like Oil and Ammonia able to be made directly.

# Brute Meds
## Libital
### Simple brute fix
- Welding Fuel, Carbon, Hydrogen (Oil) (15u)
- 3 Chlorine, 3 Water (Phenol) (45u)
- Nitrogen, Oxygen to make Libital. (135u total)

## Helbital
### Faster brute fix, no side effect when in hardcrit. Otherwise deals OXY damage
- Carbon, Fluorine, Sugar (15u)

## Probital
### Decent brutefix, deals stamina damage. If taken by mouth, makes healing peptides from food ate, boosting brute fix.
- Welding Fuel, Carbon, Hydrogen (Oil) (15u)
- Welding Fuel, Oxygen (Acetone) (45u)
- 2 Acetone, Copper, Phosphorus (88u Probital, leftover crap)

## Salicyclic Acid
### Super Brutefix beyond 25 damage, little under. 
- Welding Fuel, Carbon, Hydrogen (Oil) (15u)
- 3 Chlorine, 3 Water (Phenol) (45u)
- Sodium, Carbon, Oxygen, Sulfuric Acid (225u total)

# Burn Meds
## Aiuri
### Burnfix, does eye damage
- 3 Hydrogen, Nitrogen (Ammonia) (15u)
- Ammonia, Sulfuric Acid, 2 Hydrogen (60u total)

## Lenturi
### Stronger burnfix, stomach damage
- 3 Hydrogen, Nitrogen (Ammonia) (15u)
- Ammonia, Silver, Sulfur, Oxygen, Chlorine (75u total)

## Hercuri
### Big burn fix, makes you cold as hell. More effective at 50+ burn, can remove fire.
> Note: this is ONLY effective if put in a SPRAY BOTTLE, refill the existing ones in burn kits and keep the patient from going far as this will FREEZE them.
{.is-info}

- 2 Water, into reaction chamber set to 0 (makes 10.9 Ice)
- (Beaker 2) Iron, Oxygen, Hydrogen (15u Stabilizing Agent)
- Mix 10u Stabilizing Agent with 10u Plasma from grinding (1 sheet is 20u after grinding)
- Add Stable Plasma to Ice Beaker
- 2 Nitrogen (30u Cryostylane, 0.9 ice leftover)
- (Beaker 2) Sodium, Hydrogen, Oxygen (Lye), add to Beaker 1 (15u, 30u Cryo in beaker for 45)
- 3 Bromine, cool below 47K. (50u Hercuri with 5u ea Bromine and Lye left)

## Oxandrolone
### Super Burnfix, 25+ most effective, little under.
- Welding Fuel, Carbon, Hydrogen (Oil) (15u)
- 3 Chlorine, 3 Water (Phenol) (45u)
- 3 Carbon, Phenol, Hydrogen, Oxygen (270u total Oxandrolone, you will need to empty beaker a few times)

# TOX Meds
## Multiver
### TOXFix, purges chems from bloodstream, more TOXFix the more unique meds are in your body.
- Sodium, Chloride, Water (Table Salt) (15u)
- Welding Fuel, Carbon, Hydrogen (Oil) (15u, 30 total)
- Heat past 480. (30u Multiver)

## Seiver
### TOXFix that works on temps. 150K and below body temp does lots of TOXFix to irradiated patients
- Aluminium, Nitrogen, Potassium, ensure above 320k for 15u

## Syriniver
### Super TOXFix. Tricky to use. Dilute to a 20/80 with water, then use IV or other injections due to Syriniver becoming Musiver quickly.
(note: this requires Toxin, which may be purchased at a chem vendor)
- 3 Hydrogen, Nitrogen (Ammonia) (15u)
- 2 Ammonia, Nitrogen, 2 Oxygen, heat to 525+ (Nitrous Oxide, makes 25u)
- Sulfur, Fluorine, Toxin, 2 Nitrous Oxide

## Higadrite
### This stops toxin damage buildup from liver failure. Does not stop other sources of toxin damage
{.is-info}

- 2 Phenol, Lithium

# OXY Meds
## Tirimol
### Good OXYFix drug that puts people to sleep as it heals, dealing stamina damage
- Welding Fuel, Carbon, Hydrogen (Oil) (15u)
- Welding Fuel, Oxygen (Acetone) (45u)
- 2 Acetone, 3 Nitrogen, 1 Sulfuric Acid (catalyzer) (full acetone use nets 110u Tirimol)

## Convermol
### Strong OXYFix that quickly clears suffocation while dealing TOX.
- Welding Fuel, Carbon, Hydrogen (Oil) (15u)
- Oil, Fluorine, Hydrogen, heat to 370+ (45u Convermol)

## Salbutamol
### Super OXYFix. Slows suffocation cycles, no side effects!
- Make Salicyclic Acid above (Brute Meds)
- Salicyclic Acid, Lithium, Aluminium, Bromine, Ammonia

# ORGANFIX
## Mannitol (Weak Brainfix)
- Hydrogen, Water, Sugar (15u)

## Neurine (Strong Brainfix)
- Welding Fuel, Carbon, Hydrogen (Oil) (15u)
- Welding Fuel, Oxygen (Acetone) (45u)
- Acetone, Mannitol (see above), Oxygen.

## Oculine (Eyefix)
- Multiver (see above), Carbon, Hydrogen

## Inacusiate (Earfix)
- Multiver (see above), Carbon, Water

# OTHER STUFF

## Antihol (Alcohol purge)
- Multiver, Copper, Ethanol

## Synthflesh
- Welding Fuel, Carbon, Hydrogen (Oil) (15u)
- 3 Chlorine, 3 Water (Phenol) (45u)
- Nitrogen, Oxygen to make Libital. (135u total)
- (Beaker 2) Pour in some Libital.
- (Beaker 2) Carbon, Blood (acquired from almost anyone) in equal parts with Libital to make Synthflesh.

## Epinepherine
> Note: There's usually quite a few bottles of the stuff lying around. BUT it doesn't hurt to know how to put this together if you somehow burn it all. You'll want at least 2 beakers for this unless you got BS beakers
{.is-warning}

- Acetone, Chlorine, Diethylamine, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Phenol (Makes Epi).

## Formaldehyde (No Organ Rot)
- Ethanol, Oxygen, Silver, heat to 400K. (15u)

## Plastic
> Frankly, every chemist should know this and this should be their first priority so that there's plastic to use to make things like metamaterial beakers, drapes, etc
{.is-info}
