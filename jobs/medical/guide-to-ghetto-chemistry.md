# Guide to Ghetto Chemistry

# Starting out

So, you are an average Greytide and you want to be a Walter White. How do you do it? First off, you're gonna wanna get these things to get started with ghetto chem.

- A few beakers, soda cans, bottles, etc
- A couple of tables to store your beakers, so you don't spill your shit on the floor

Most importantly, without this you dont have ghetto chem:

- An all in one grinder, to grind some things into liquid form. Optionally make a mortar Mortar1.png and pestle Pestle.png.

Optionally:

- A ChemMaster 3000 to separate and bottle chemicals.

Remember that you can use matches, lighters, and igniters to heat containers as well. 

# Upgrading your tools

Once you have a decent set of beakers and the like, it can be worth upgrading the tools you'll be using to manage your reactions. There are a number of tools that'll help you that can be created in the crafting menu and otherwise.

## Thermometer

This can be added to anything that holds chemicals, and will tell you the temperature. To remove, close the UI.

## Cooling spray

This can be crafted to spray on your beakers to cool down the reagents within, alternatively fire extinquishers can be used instead. In a pinch, this can double as a weak extinguisher too.

## Burners

These tabletop burners will allow you to heat up your beakers simply by waving your container over it. It'll burn the reagent inside, and the temperature increase will depend on the burning temperature of the reagent contained within. For a quick reference

- Ethanol - burns very hot and for a long time
- Welding fuel - burns hot and fast
- Oil - doesn't burn as hot as the others, but lasts a long time
- Plasma - Hottest burning temperature and will be used up the quickest
- Pyrosium - Hottest burning temperature and burns through slowly, but requires oxygen to be in the burner as well
- Cyrostylane - Burns at 0K, very cold, can be used to cool beakers instead, requires oxygen to be in the burner as well
- Cryoxadone - Burns cold, can be used to cool beakers instead

If you put a mix in the burner, the flame temperature will by the weighted sum of the reagents within. To add reagents to the burner, simply snuff out the flame and pour stuff in, to light it, use a lighter or a match!

## Improvised chem heater

For the ghetto enthusiast, a space heater can be refactored into an impromptu chem heater- allowing you much finer control over the temperature specifics of your reactions. If you're planning on making anything difficult, or want to have better control over your temperatures, this is the best way to do it.

## Barrels

When you got a chemical that requires a lot of acid, stable plasma or other base chems in order to stabilize so you don't get blown up, this is for you. All you have to do is pour the chemicals in, Barrels can hold 300 units of reagents.

# Grindables

Not only can you steal things, but you can also shove them into a grinder to retrieve chemicals from them!

If you're stealing from Botany, check out the Guide to hydroponics.
