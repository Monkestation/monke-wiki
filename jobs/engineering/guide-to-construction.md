# Guide to Construction

> This page is under construction.
{.is-warning}


So, you're probably lost on building something. Well, let's get some work done.

An important note: If you are doing work on structural elements like doors, windows, walls and the like, use the deconstruction

# Computers

Modular consoles, whatever the heck you wanna call'm. You wanna build something that somewhat resembles one of these: (add picture). Well, buckle up buttercup. This is the easy stuff here.
Get yourself the following:
- 5 sheets of iron
- 2 sheets of glass
- a **COMPUTER BOARD** of whatever it is you want in it, like an operating computer board.
- 5 wire (not whole coils)

And make sure you got yourself a standard toolbelt. At minimum, wrench an' screwdriver for buildin' most things.

To build the comptuer:

- Use the iron in hand (or use the crafting menu) and build a **computer frame**.
- **Wrench** the frame into place.
- Pop in the **computer board**.
- **Screwdriver** the board into place.
- **Wire** the assembly.
- Add **glass**.
- Screwdriver to finalize the construction. It should pop up and start working, provided the power ain't gone.

Deconstruction is almost as easy. It's in reverse, but get the toolbelt.

- **Screwdriver** the computer open
- **Crowbar** the glass out
- Snip the wires with **wirecutters**.
- **Screwdriver** to loosen the board.
- **Crowbar** the board out.
- **Wrench** the frame to make it loose.
- (Optional) Use a **welder** to take apart the computer frame if its not needed.

Comptuers! Easy!

# Machines

This is slightly more complex, but the basics will carry you through building these. Think of things like the proto fabs, fax machines, cell charters, weapon rechargers and even vending machines. All of these are stocked off a machine frame.

## The Machine Frame

Get yourself the following:

- 5 sheets of iron
- 5 wires
- a wrench

Set it up:

- Use the iron sheets in hand (or use the crafting menu) to assemble a **machine frame**.
- **Wrench** the frame into place (some machines may allow assembly without being wrenched down)
- Add wires

The machine frame is now ready to accept a **MACHINE BOARD**. When you are choosing to build a particular machine, most of those boards are in a circuit imprinter. The boards themselves will show what stock parts will be required in order to assemble the final machine.

Once the parts are in place, **screwdriver** it together. To disassemble, **screwdriver** it open and then **crowbar** it.

# Basic Constructions



We have two ways to go about at least the first bit: walls and floors.

The Easy Way:
- Get a Rapid Construction Device (**RCD**)
- Use the **RCD** in your hand.
- Set it to walls, windows, floors, whatever you desire.
- Click to build. Watch your matter consumption. Refill with **iron or glass**. You may also make matter cartridges to some extent.

Now that the easy way, and now the hard way

## Floors
- If there is a neighboring tile that is still a valid floor, you can simply place a **floor tile** in the empty space without girders and a floor will be placed. Otherwise, use **iron rods** then **floor tile**.


## Walls

You'll need the following:

- iron sheets (for girders)
- wrench
- plasteel sheets (for reinforced walls)

Now, to start building by hand:

- Use **iron sheets** to build girders.
- Anchor the girder with a **wrench** if you build an unanchored girder.
- Use **iron sheets** on the girder to build regular wall. You may substitute virtually **any material** to build a material wall.
- For reinforced walls, use **plasteel sheets** on the girders to reinforce it. (1 sheet)
- On a reinforced girder, use **plasteel sheets** to finish the reinforced wall. (2 sheets)

## APCs
Busted APCs are gonna be a bread and butter sort of thing that you will inevitably fix often.
We'll start off with deconstruction, because odds are its fucked, then we'll go into building a replacement.

- Look at the busted APC. If the cover is completely destroyed, move on. If it is not, use an appropriate tool to bust off the cover.
- Remove the floor tile immediately in front of the APC/
- Remove the power cell with your **hand**.
- Cut the terminal connection with **wirecutters**.
- Use a **screwdriver** on the potentially destroyed board
- **Crowbar** out the board.
- Use a **welder** to remove the damaged/destroyed frame off the wall.

To rebuild:

- Use 2 iron sheets to build an **APC Frame**. Stick it on the wall.
- Remove the floor tile in front of the APC, if not already done.
- Place a new **APC Module** and then **screwdriver** it into place.
- Use 5 **wires** to build a terminal connection for the APC.
- Place a **power cell** into the APC.
- **Crowbar** the cover closed.
- **Turn on** the main breaker and any other breakers as needed.

## Air Alarms
Another bread and butter construction, though these are broken just less frequently.

Deconstruction:

- Open the cover with a **screwdriver**.
- Snip all the wires with a **wirecutter**.
- Remove the wiring with **wirecutters**.
- **Crowbar** out the control board.
- Use a **wrench** to pull the frame off the wall.

Construction:

- Place an **Air Alarm Frame** on the wall. (2 sheets)
- Place an **Air Alarm Electronics** board in the frame.
- **Wire** the air alarm. (5 pieces)
- **Screwdriver** the cover closed.
- Configure the settings of the air alarm as needed.

## Light Fixtures

Most lights will follow the same pattern of construction, regardless if they're stick lights on a wall, bulbs on a wall or even floor lights.

Deconstruction:
- Remove the **lightbulb**.
- **Screwdriver** the frame open.
- Remove the **light battery**.
- Use **wirecutters** to remove the wiring.
- Use a **wrench** to deconstruct the frame.

Construction: 
- Build a **light fixture frame** and place it on a wall.
- Add **wiring** to the frame.
- (Optional but a good idea) Place a **light battery** into the frame.
- **Screwdriver** the frame closed.
- Stick a light in.

## Fire Alarms

Simple machine.

Deconstruction:

- **Screwdriver** open the cover.
- **Cut** the wires.
- **Crowbar** out the electronics.
- **Wrench** the frame off the wall.

Construction:

- Build a **fire alarm frame** and place it on the wall.
- Add **fire alarm electronics**.
- Add **wires**.
- **Screwdriver** it shut.

## Firelocks

Deconstruction:
- **Weld** the firelock shut.
- **Unscrew** the floor bolts.
- **Unwrench** the floor bolts. This makes the firelock movable.
- **Crowbar** the circuits out.
- **Weld** the firelock frame apart.

Construction:
- Assemble a **firelock frame**.
- Place the **firelock circuitry** in the frame
- Bolt into place with a **wrench**.

## Airlocks

The Easy Way: Use an **RCD**.

The Hard Way:
