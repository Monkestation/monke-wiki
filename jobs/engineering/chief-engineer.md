## Job Description 
The Chief Engineer is suppossed to be a senior engineer that has the know how to keep the engineering department functional. Ontop of maintaining engineering the Chief Engineer is excpected to be able to assist and teach others in how to keep the most important department of the station alive.

The Engineering department can be either staffed with the best and brightest, able of making insane contraptions that even go past your comprehension. Or with idiots that accidentaly get the ~~Supermatter delamination world record~~ Engine to fail quite quickly. It is your job to either explain to the captain why you let the most green engineers setup the sm without any guidance, or help them along yourself.

Ontop of herding your engineers and techs into not turning the station uninhabitable the chief engineer has the most authority in commissioning new projects aboard the station to ~~Distract the bored engineers~~ improve quality of life apon the station. It should be you coordinating with other departments to get everyone to a happier situation.




## Power generation
This is engineering's most important job so it is also your most important job. there are three main ways of generating power on the station.
### ![supermatter_shard.png](/jobs/engineering/supermatter_shard.png) The Supermatter
This is the most common engine your station will have, its the most complex to set up but the safest to run. Do not let newbies handle this on their own.
### ![scrungularity.png](/jobs/engineering/scrungularity.png) The Singularity
This engine is the 2nd most complicated while being the most dangerous. If you have a choice between this or the tesla, build a tesla
### ![moth_lamp.gif](/jobs/engineering/moth_lamp.gif) The Tesla
The Tesla is the easiest and is much less dangerous then the Singularity. It doesnt require any upkeep after being made while producing a great ammount of electricity.
