The station's life support engineer. What you do is rather simple: if there is any sort of environmental disaster, head off and fix it! You have your tools, your engineering headset, Rapid Pipe Dispenser (RPD), space heaters, and atmospheric survival equipment. When things get quiet, sit back and start building an on station super slide while people ask why you even work here. When things go wrong, people will scream at you and ask why you even work here.

Bare minimum requirements: Fight fires, seal hull breaches and restore the atmosphere in rooms that can't support life. Know how to fix sabotage to Atmospherics. Secure dat fukken axe.
Basic skills: Know what the pipe loops and air alarm settings do. Optimize the waste loop so it doesn't get clogged in case of a hull breach (cold gases) or plasma fire (hot gases). Carry an Atmos Holoprojector with you.
Advanced skills: Know about moles/volume and the properties of gases. Perform gas synthesis to create rare and exotic gasses to help (or harm) the station. Selectively cause plasma floods to slow down a blob/xenomorph/spider infestation. Know the basics of Ordnance and Engineering.

# Firebender

As the Atmospheric Technician, you have what should be a simple and easy job: Keep Atmospherics operational and make sure the station doesn't burn down or run out of breathable air. As long as you have a good idea of how everything works, then this shouldn't be much of an issue. Atmosia may be a daunting mess of pipes, but after a few shifts of toying around with it, it will all make sense.

Basically, being an Atmospheric Technician can be easy if you want to make it easy. You can sit around and do minor improvements and fix atmos issues around the station, or you could be an absolute madman and perform ritual magic with Fusion Reactor bullshit and make advanced gasses. Your choice. 

#  Atmosia

The great city state of pipes, where all the station's air comes from and where waste gas collected from around the station is sent. It is used as a jetpack recharge station for Syndicate Agents, a hideout for Wizards, a breeding ground of Xenos, and has a general alert computer that will tell if any place is messed up.

It's an awfully lonely place on the station; people rarely come here other than your fellow atmos techs. It is possible to do a lot of harm to the station from here if you know how, though.

Everything you would need to know about atmos and how it works is on the main Guide to atmospherics page, though here are a few notes for general knowledge:

- The station's Distro and Waste pipelines that go to every room's vents/scrubbers are on separate pipe layers and are differently colored. Distro is blue and is on layer 4, Waste is red on layer 2. Incoming waste gas and outgoing air enter and leave through the distribution room usually separated from the rest of atmospherics by glass.
- Pipes automatically connect with pipes of the same color and layer. Grey "omni" pipes connect to all colors on the same layer. The default layer is 3.
- Removing pipes will release their contents to the surrounding air. Pipes under high pressure can send you flying if you finish unwrenching them and can seriously injure you if you hit something! A red warning message will show up in your chat if it's under high pressure.
- You can attach/detach gas canisters to canister ports by using a wrench on the canister while it's on top of the port. Any gas in the pipes connected to the canister port will fill any attached canister to the same pressure.

Please keep in mind that making Atmospherics sabotage-proof (for example by removing the plasma tank from the loop) before you have decent IC evidence that someone is going to sabotage it is considered metagaming. 

# What you Can do to Pass the Time

Atmos Techs usually have no clue what they can do, and often drift into a spiral of depression and suicide. Fret not! Here are some suggestions for you to do. 

##  Laying Some Pipe

You have one super useful handheld tool, the Rapid Piping Device (RPD)! Clicking the RPD while it's in your hand to use it (or using the hotkey Z by default) will open it's interface, allowing you to pick and choose which kind of pipe you want to install! To install gas pipes, simply click on the one you want in the interface and click on a tile. It'll automatically be wrenched in place! You can also select 5 different layers to place the pipes on and a wide range of colors. Note that pipes automatically connect to pipes of the same color on the same layer. Grey "omni" pipes connect to all colors on the same layer. Separate layers of pipes NEVER interact unless connected with a layer manifold. Right-clicking a gas pipe will quickly copy the pipe's layer and color for ease of use. You can also restrict which ways placed pipes can and cannot automatically connect in by using the arrow buttons on the left. By default all the arrows are green, meaning pipes can connect in all directions.

The RPD can eat loose pipes if you have no need for them any longer. Just use your wrench to unsecure the offending pipe and left click on the loose pipe with your RPD to destroy it!

Your RPD also has two separate sections for dispensing disposals pipes and transit tubes! For both, the RPD will dispense them wrenched to the floor. After that you must then weld them to seal it all together to be functional. Keep a welding helmet handy for these jobs if you plan on doing repairs. When encountering broken disposal pipe ends, you can click on the broken ends with the RPD to remove them without having to weld them off. Even better, you can just place a disposal pipe in the same position as the old destroyed one and it'll remove the damaged ends as well as place the pipe!

## Repressurization and Filtering

After the Engineers have taken care of a hull breach (read: if), or after Toxins floods the place with plasma, it'll be your job to refill the area and make it breathable.

This can be done by using the Atmosphere Alarms mounted in most areas, along with the vents and scrubbers in the area. The primary utility of the Atmosphere Alarm is to send alerts when the air around the alarm falls into less than favorable conditions based on gas temperature, pressure, and composition. Atmosphere Alarms also control the vents and the scrubbers in the room they're in, and these can be individually turned on/off and adjusted from the Atmosphere Alarms.

To unlock the alarm, either swipe your ID card on them, or simply ALT click while the card is in your ID slot to quickly unlock it. Remember to lock them when you're done with them to prevent unwanted tampering!

The alarms can be set to a number of modes:

- Filtering - The default setting. Vents will put air in at 101kpa and scrubbers will remove CO2. Note that most scrubbers won't filter out plasma or other gases unless you set them to, so do that!
- Contaminated - The second setting and the most useful one. Sets all the scrubbers to remove everything except for O2 and N2, and sets their range to "expanded".
- Draught - This filters out air slowly, creating a draught. Useful if you need to drain a small amount of air due to overpressurization.
- Replace Air - Drains all the air, then replaces it. Try not to use it if there's nothing toxic in the air.
- Refill - Triples the output on the vents to 303kpa. Useful only if you've increased the pressure in the air distribution pipe from atmos.
- Panic Siphon - This drains all the air quickly. Most of the time used to remove all plasma very quickly, or by a malfunctioning AI.

Normally the vents will fill the room slowly by default, though using some filled Portable Air Pumps, or Air Canisters you can refill the area much more quickly.

A tip in refilling: Each vent has a pressure check value on it, and is by default set to pressure check externally - this means that the vent attempts to bring the tile it's on to the listed pressure. A rapid manner of refilling an area is to remove the external pressure check, switch it over to the internal check - this attempts to regulate the pressure in the pipes of and running to the vent below, which is directly fed by the distribution loop pump in the north end of Atmosia. Setting the "pressure bound" variable to zero with internal pressure checks attempts to void all air in the pipes, effectively reducing their pressure to zero and, in the process, flooding air at an alarming rate into the area. Given the impractically slow rate at which the air alarms normally fill the area, this can be a very expeditious way to work. Pressure is dangerous, so don't simply leave the vent alone for extended periods of time, as you can, eventually, turn smaller areas into death-traps if there is enough pressure in the distribution loop. 

## Pass Some Gas

You can purge the air out of rooms using an emergency siphon, or change the air filter controls with the air alarm attached to walls! Just take your ID in hand, and click to un/lock it and play with the controls. Setting up the pumps in Atmos now allows you to pump any gas to any point in the station! You could also do this more manually with the use of Portable Air Pumps if you needed to.

Protip: Pure oxygen lets people survive in a breached compartment much longer.

Protip: Pure oxygen makes plasma fires much, much worse.

Protip: Since you're in charge of both breathing and firefighting, Murphy's Law says you're screwed. 

## Window Repair

A good way to be proactive within your job is fixing the broken windows that occur every round. Gird your loins with a toolbelt if you can, grab some metal and glass, and patrol the outer passageways. Almost always, the task requires a low-pressure or no-pressure exposure to the great beyond. By creatively rotating and moving surviving windows (or using your holofan projector) you can lock in your precious atmosphere, then replace the broken glass and grill. The truly hardcore technicians do minor spacewalks with only the flame of their welding torch for heat, sipping sweet oxygen through their breath masks behind a welding helmet. Are you hardcore? No, you're not. Go back to being a hardsuited engineer who can't find a hull breach without a pair of mesons and never bothers to fix them anyway.

## Assist the Engineers

They might not be the brightest compared to your UNMATCHED INTELLECT IN MATTERS OF ATMOS, but the Station Engineers you work along with have a similar job in repairing and maintaining the station! If everyone on the station can breath and there isn't any hazardous atmosphere conditions, you could help out the engineers with any projects they might have. You could add your skills and tools in to help if atmospherics work is needed. For example, building a new area on the exterior of the station! That new area is gonna need some air and proper atmospherics infrastructure, right? 

That's the best case scenario. Worst case, you're saving the engineers from their own self-made disaster in the Supermatter Engine. 

## Gaseous Synthesis

An under utilized part of atmospherics technician gameplay is the ability to react certain gasses together in various ways to synthesize completely new kinds of gas! From as simple as Tritium and BZ to difficult as Zauker and Anti-Noblium, there are a variety of gasses you can make with the right mixture, pressure and temperature. The various types of gas, their function and their requirements to form can be found at the Guide to Atmospherics. 

## Sell Gas for Fun and Profit

There's two methods of selling off gas that's in atmospherics already or produced through reactions; through bluespace gas vendors and exporting them at cargo. Both ways grant you personally no credits at all! (If you want some money for yourself, complete bounties at the terminal outside cargo.)

Inside atmospherics there's a clunky looking machine called the Bluespace Gas Sender. This machine acts as a storage device for gas to be remotely sold from Bluespace vendor.gif Bluespace Gas Vendors found across the station on walls. Simply hook a pipe to the sender and turn it on, and it'll pump in any gas from the connected pipe into the sender. Gas that enters the sender is automatically temperature adjusted to 293.15k, or room temperature. The interface will display colorful meters for each kind of gas and their amount in mols. The price of each gas can be set individually, the defaults are the cargo export price. The button in the top right when pressed will eject the vendor's contents into the connected pipe. At gas vendors, customers can make their custom mixes by filling by percentages. All profits go into the engineering budget that can be then spent by the Chief Engineer. This is a decent way of getting your fancy new gasses spread to the rest of the crew or at the very least distributing cheap oxygen for emergencies.

As for exporting in cargo, you can put gasses in canisters and have the staff at Cargo export them to make the station a lot of money! Ideally you should put gas in at around 20C, as putting more than roughly 2100 mols in a canister will aggressively reduce the price per mol of your canister. Ship off multiple canisters of 2000 mols or less and you don't have to worry about this. With a substantial gift like a full canister of Healium (roughly 27k credits a canister!!!) you'd definitely become friends with the Quartermaster.

## Make some Physical Items in the Crystallizer

There are even more uses for the gas you make! The Crystallizer is a tall machine that can be built or sometimes found on some stations. It has two gas ports, one red port for temperature control and one green port for gas input. By combining gas mixtures together in the Crystallizer's chamber within the right temperature range (being controlled by the red port), gasses can be crystallized to into physical items with a variety of functions of uses. Crystal grenades to seal breaches, fill the air and fix temperature issues, solidifying gas into solid plasma and diamonds, pressure-proofing crystals for clothing, super strong and elusive Metal Hydrogen, a god damn Supermatter shard, and more! As long as the machine is on and is fed more gas, automated factories could be made to produce Crystallizer items. For more details, once again, see the Guide to Atmospherics. 

## Set up the Turbine Engine

The Turbine Engine is one of the few places where atmospheric technicians can help to generate power. First, max up the pumps leading to and away from the turbine. Up in atmospherics, isolate the black pipes, and inject plasma and oxygen into it via the pumps/computers. Set a filter to create a 66% oxygen and 33% plasma mix, otherwise known as a burn mix. Then input that burn mix into the turbine, and voila, it's generating a relatively steady 110 KW. (which pales when compared to what the Supermatter Engine can do, but well, it's a tertiary engine after all, with solars being the secondary power source). The output can be increased with upgraded parts, if desired.

However, the Turbine combustion chamber is far more useful as a burn chamber for the production of Tritium and Water Vapor if the Supermatter Engine and solars are set up. 

## Set up the Gas Powered Nuclear Donut: The Hyper-torus Fusion Reactor

The crown jewel of atmospherics autism projects, the Hyper-torus Fusion Reactor (commonly abbreviated as HFR) is a large 3x3 machine that facilitates the process of nuclear fusion most commonly using a mixture of Tritium and Hydrogen as fuel, though other fuel mixtures are available with different effects on the HFR. Despite what you may think, this reactor doesn't produce any power on it's own and primarily exists as an alternative to creating the various gasses normally made with gas reactions. It has 4 gas ports on each side for fuel input, coolant, a moderator gas input to facilitate the fusion and a waste output for waste gas and/or finished products, as well as it's own complex interface for tracking temperature and adjusting the fuel injection rate, heating conductor, coolant volume, etc.

Setup for the HFR needs to be entirely from scratch unlike the Supermatter engine, so plan on spending a good chunk of time on preparing to run the HFR if you wish to try your hand at it. Most stations have a dedicated spot for you to build the machine with convenient markings on the floor and quick-setup boxes for rapid deployment of the whole thing.

The HFR is incredibly hazardous compared even to the Supermatter engine: it emits a hilarious amount of radiation while running (more-so than even the Supermatter engine, wear a radsuit!), power outages are incredibly dangerous for the HFR, each level of fusion produces more and more heat and energy, and higher levels of operation and different fuels can create added hazards ranging from firing off nuclear particles to huge arcs of shocking electricity. A fusion reactor meltdown will cause a large and violent explosion, expelling heat and gas everywhere along with a large EMP blast and radiation wave.

This all may sound scary and daunting, and it is! Just read the guide and ask around for advice or help on running the thing. Once you understand the fusion donut it's not actually all that bad. 

## Total Emergency: The Fire Axe and you

The Fire Axe is your tool during emergencies (because you can use it as a crowbar to open an airlock when the power is off) and your holy weapon (traitors, revolutionaries, and cultists usually try to steal the axe because you can kill a person in seconds). It's one of the strongest melee weapons available to the crew right off the start of the round, though it needs to be two-handed (use it in your hand with your other hand empty) for it to do it's full damage. It can instantly break any kind of window wielded, and it has a unique quirk of being able to pry open some blast doors like those used to lock down the Brig during riots.

The fire axe is protected with a Fire Axe Cabinet. To open it, just take a multitool and use it on the cabinet to reset the circuitry and unlock it. Or you could just do it the classic way and give it a good whack a couple of times with a lit welder or some other hefty blunt object, that works as well too. If you resisted the urge to break the glass, you can use a crowbar to close the glass and a multitool again to reset the circuitry to relock it. 

## BE THE FIREFIGHTER THE STATION DESERVES

A fire is easily the most fun thing that can happen in a round (for you anyway); successful firefighting requires a real understanding of the atmospheric system. At all times, wear basic tools in a toolbelt and carry your firefighting gear in your backpack. When the call goes out, don your fire suit and gas mask, get yourself running on internals, put your oxygen tank in your firesuit storage, and carry your fire first aid kit, extinguisher and reinforced glass in your backpack.

Drag a water tank behind you and get to the fire. With AI cooperation, have the burning area bolted or welded off, save one access point the AI can monitor. This keeps the fire from spreading and chucklefucks from wandering into a fiery doom. Seal the singular entrance with a holofan to block gas from escaping while maintaining an entry. Once inside, you must quickly determine the sort of fire you are dealing with. Pressure tanks of plasma can release massive amounts of fuel (or even burst!) and must be shut off or isolated immediately, while the best way to isolate broken pipes is to box them in with reinforced glass or holofans until a proper repair can be done. With fuel shut off, find the atmospheric alarm and set it to Panic Siphon.

This drains air out of the room completely. With this process started, check for survivors or bodies and either apply burn patches and epinephrine or simply remove them from the compartment via your access point and alert any Paramedics. Next, seek out any ignition sources such as lit zippo lighters and disable them, reporting them to security for their forensic investigation. Then proceed with extinguishing any remaining pockets of flame. Once the fire is cleared out, focus on clearing any remaining plasma from the atmosphere by dragging in a scrubber.

Finally, set the atmosphere alarm to pump in fresh air. It may take several cycles of filling and draining the room to clear all plasma and make larger areas inhabitable again, but once you are done, head to the bar and score some babes while Engineers clean up the mess.

(Note this lengthy guide is only really useful for those big "Research done herped-a-derp" fires that engulf Med/Sci or are caused by very skillful arsonists. Smaller fires, such as the sort chemists who just learned the napalm recipe cause, really only require some fire-extinguisher blasts and setting up a room's scrubber to remove plasma and CO2. Never presume, however, that you won't need your full toolkit. This author spent well-nigh an hour in the fiery bowels of med-sci on one occasion, but not only did I never have to leave after I stepped in and sealed it off, but I had the situation so well under control that after five minutes normal shipboard life resumed and admins eventually had to spawn facehuggers to return a sense of danger to the crew.)

But wait! Theres more. Let me introduce you to a little something called... 

### ATMOS Resin

By taking one of the Backpack Firefighter Tanks Waterbackpack atmos.png from one of your lockers in Atmospherics, you can become the ultimate firefighting machine. This stuff works like a miracle when dealing with mass Plasma floods, and may be your only chance at stopping massive fires.

The resin it spews has the following effects:

- Repairs hull breaches similarly to Metal Foam.
- Cleans the air from toxins.
- Normalises air temperature to room temperature (20°C or 293.15K).
- Seals open vents (as if they were welded shut).
- Removes slipperiness from floors (from water etc).
- The foam itself is not slippery.

To use the Backpack Firefighter Tank, equip it on your backpack slot and click the new hud icon to take out the nozzleAtmos nozzle.png. You can then cycle modes between extinguisher, resin launcher and single tile resin launcher (foamer) by activating the nozzle in your hand. It spends water when used. Use the nozzle on a water tank to refill it. Examine the nozzle to see water remaining. More of these bad boys can be ordered from cargo.

DO NOT spray a Supermatter engine with atmos resin if you don't want it to delaminate. Sure, it seems like a good idea if it's on fire and full of plasma, but impairing the movement of gasses around the crystal doesn't help the situation the way you might think. If you want to put out SME fires manually use the yellow advanced fire extinguishers that are located in your locker. They spray firefighting foam that is much better for this kind of job. 

# Tips

- Ninety-plus percent of people don't know jack shit about Atmospherics.
- It may sound obvious, but sealing breaches as fast as possible is critical to not only helping out the rest of the crew, it also cuts back on the amount of work you have to put in later. The longer the area is exposed to space, the more time air has to escape and cool down, the ultimate root cause of the infamous Firelock Hell. Meaning of course, more time you have to spend refilling the air and heating parts of the station until the firelocks lift.
- Holofans projected on the same tile as firelocks will force the firelock to stay open to allow easier passage through heavily firelocked areas.
- With major station damage due to meteor storms or mass catastrophic bombing, your primary goal is to secure safe passage through departures. Seal up the breaches, shore up the damaged parts with smart metal foam and ATMOS resin, and get some portable pumps running to keep at least the pressure within tolerable conditions. The situation may not be salvageable, but you can at least make evacuation a lot safer.
- Air pumps can fill tanks beyond the ~1013.25 kPa pressure limit. Connect the pump to a port, then pop in a canister.
- Firesuits protect between 60 to 30,000 Kelvin.
- Setting air vents to 0 kPa internal check (or just turning off the check) will make them pump out air like crazy, which makes it excellent to restore air to an area quickly. But be careful with the pressure on the vent tile itself, if the pressure in the outgoing distro loop is very high it might be dangerous. ADDED: Don't max the vents. Set the vents to internal and desired pressure 0 instead. Maxed vents at 5000 KPA in a 100 KPA room will output 2450 KPA in the first tick, then 1225 KPA, 612.5 KPA, 306.25 KPA, 153.125 KPA, etc etc (assuming vents are always provided with max air). Zero'd vents will output 5000 KPA, then 5000 KPA, then 5000 KPA, etc.
- N2O knocks out in low amounts, suffocates in high amounts.
- If you're an atmos tech trying to repair a hull breach without a fire/space suit: Turn off the vents. No more air will be vented into the room, which means there won't be any space wind to fight against if you accidentally fall out the window.
- Atmos tech is actually an interesting job, disposal tubes give such wonderful opportunities for killing people, however, it takes a shitton of time to build everything you need.
- Any sort of air mix is survivable as long as it has at least 16 kPa of oxygen on the output. This means you can easily compute the release pressure you'd need for a given airmix by dividing 16 by the percentage of oxygen in the mix; i.e. for 20/80 O2/N2 air mix you'd need a release pressure of 16/0.2 = 80 to be fine.
- An extremely good idea when setting up atmos at the start of the shift is to replace the waste intake pump with a volume pump and to increase the pressure output of the air to distro pump to something above 303pka, probably more. The reasons/pros/cons for this and more are explained on the Guide to Atmospherics more, but in short, more air in distro makes the vents work faster and the volume pump can help bring gas into atmos faster in more scenarios than the gas pump.
- A maxed volume pump and a maxed normal pump pump at the same rate given ideal circumstances. The difference is the volume pump won't stop pumping once its output end is at 4500 kpa or more. This makes it excellent for waste in, where no matter how much gas the previous fire/atmos experiment clogged the filtering loop with, Waste In is still pumping waste out of the scrubbers pipes, and by extension, helping keep the scrubbers from getting clogged to the point of uselessness.
- Black Pill: Setting up atmos doesn't really matter that much anyway as long as you give the distro loop some pressure. The entire supply and equipment is designed for a space station that's supposed to last months. There's about two instances in which a proper setup is useful: massive hullbreaches which will drain a lot of air (most of which will then uselessly disappear in space anyway) and station-wide plasma fires which might fill the waste loop (in which case you're at fault as an atmos tech for not keeping an eye on the system in the first place).
- If you are an atmos tech and want to greatly reduce possibility of harmful atmos manipulations... or if you are an AI and you spotted a guy just turning valves to release plasma to distro:

- Open atmospherics console for a specific chamber and toggle power on output. 90% of players don't check this console. As AI I laughed many times as sabotager was running back and forth, checking every pump 3 times, and still, no plasma appeared. In this way you can also shut down harmful gases pumping when one is smart and changed pipes under grilles.
- Or put manual valves in front of every harmful gas, switch out some gas pumps for volumetric pumps, and adjust the mixing pipes to disallow the mix tank to provide into the distro. Beware: Setting up Atmos in such a way it can't be sabotaged by the AI before there's a reason to think the AI might sabotage Atmos is not only metagaming, it is also bannable. If you see this happen, adminhelp it!)

- You can rotate a pipe in your hand by clicking on it.
- Fire extinguishers fit in firesuit suit storage.
- The Fire Axe Cabinet can be opened with a multitool.
- You can disable fire alarms by multitooling them.
- You can trigger fire alarms by shooting them with a projectile or hitting them with anything.

# Oxygen is Overrated

Traitor atmos techs have the potential to become one of the most devastating forces on station. If you know what you're doing, you can pretty much flood the station with whatever harmful gas you want. If you do, remember to take measures against the AI messing with your work, and always keep your internals on. This means either subverting the AI or cutting its access. If you're feeling particularly daring, you can unwrench the pipes and rearrange them, ensuring the AI cannot fix it. Bolt the doors, or set the room on fire to prevent humans from fixing it too. Depending on how bad it's going to be, you might want to procure a space suit to escape the hell you've created.

Your powers aren't just limited to grand sabotage of the station's life support and air. Using gas synthesis, the Hyper-torus Fusion Reactor and the Crystallizer you can make some pretty nifty gasses and items from said gas! Super flammable gas, stun immunity stimulant gasses, healing gas, crystallized N2O gas grenades, Elder Atmosian armor and many more things. Sure, it'll take forever to make any of this stuff compared to just flooding a place with deadly gas, but the cool and style factor by knowing how to make these things will grant you respect even amongst your enemies. 

## Tips for Traitoring

- Again, ninety-plus percent of people don't know jack shit about Atmospherics.
- There are some people that know about atmospherics, you can ask the Chief Engineer or certain atmospheric technicians.
- The incinerator can easily be used to create canisters of pure death.
- Plasma + N2O is extremely deadly if you can get someone to use it as internals/force them to use it. They won't even be able to scream.
- Wielded fire-axes break grilles and reinforced windows. In one shot. And open unpowered doors and kill people fairly reliably.
- You can change sensor settings on air alarms so it doesn't cause an alarm by setting the value to 1, which turns that sensor off. Do it for all sensors and you can get rid of pesky alarms that are pretty much already fixed, or hide atmos fuckery.
- Make Tier 2 Burn mix canisters with heating 15% plasma, 85% oxygen in a tier 2 canister, wait until it's ready then drag it somewhere and crack it open at max before running, it will cause a hellacious plasma fire that will mass-melt the floor and people into space.
- flood the station with harmful gasses by putting the "plasma to pure" pipe at max, "Grey pure to mix" at max, "plasma mixture node 2" to 100%, "Pure to Mix" at max, "Mix to Distro" at max. For a fine touch, turn on "Mix to engine", set it to max if you feel generous with plasma. then you set all the fire alarm hazard thresholds for plasma at -1.00 and set the thing to draught to flood, repeat for every fire alarm.
- You can make a powerful single-tank bomb assembly gas mix by pumping in 2553kPa of plasma heated to 698.15 Kelvin into an empty handheld oxygen tank (not the small emergency ones).
