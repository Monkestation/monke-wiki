# HEADS UP! This is also the Guide to Engineering

## Description 
Engineers could be described as greytiders that keep the station alive. With the tools to tear down the entire station and the responsibility of keeping the station the exact oposite the engineer has a job more important then any redshirt or scientist.

Basic Duties: Get power running, keep the holes to a minimum, do what people request.

Advanced Duties: Know how to fix Tcomms, know enough about atmos to annoy the technicians, Identify and fix sabotoge. 



## Round start 
The round start of engineering is very important, delays in completing tasks can lead to problems down the line for every other department.
### Looting frenzy
When your shift first starts there are many things you will not have that you will very much need. 
A small list of items to grab is:
- ![igloves.png](/jobs/engineering/igloves.png) Insulated Gloves 
- ![mglasses.png](/jobs/engineering/mglasses.png) Meson Goggles 
- ![rpd.png](/jobs/engineering/rpd.png) RPD (Rapid Pipe Dispenser) 
- ![weldinghelmet.png](/jobs/engineering/weldinghelmet.png) Welding mask

These 3 main items will allow you to observe, manipulate, and ~~control the station to bend it under your will~~ fix and maintain the station.

There are other items in engineering that can greatly assist your work but are in much more limited supply, an example is the engineering hardsuits (only 3) which wont be enough if the station is full of engineers. These pieces of equipment should be perserved due to how useful they are for preforming critical repairs.
### Looting over, work now.
Step 1 - **START THE ENGINE**
Whether its the [SM](/jobs/engineering/Guidetosupermatter) or [Tesla/Singularity](/jobs/engineering/GuidetoTesSing) you need to get the power generation started fast, as the station really likes sucking whatever little power the SMES start with. PS: dont forget to set the SMES!

Step 2 - Backup power systems.
The main backup power system in the station is the solar arrays, you will need a spaceproof suit and plenty of extra wire. These systems do not generate enough power to supply the station on its own, but will delay power loss in an emergency.

To get the solar array prepared, simply connect every pannel and the tracking array with wires. The solar array is connected to a pressurized room with the control pannel, set the controller to auto tracking and you can leave it alone for the rest of the shift! 
Note: orbits are a thing and the solars will have a dynamic power generation, dont be afraid if the power is 0 on start.

## After the start
After the first 10 minutes into the shift engineering should be stabilized (Unless theres nukies) you should start in maintaining the station.
### Maint hunting
A common problem is hearing on radio that some room has lost power in the station, the main source of this is cut wires from mice in maintence, reconnecting wires will shock people so its your job with your fancy insulated gloves to fix these breaks and restore power
### QRF
A slightly more important and flashy job is to be on standby for breaches and bodies stuck in space. Make sure to have metal and a space suit on you and know where to find an air cansiter and space heater. It is your duty as an engineer to not let rooms in the station be voided.
### Work Projects
While an engineer usually wont be questioned if they're caught slacking, it is more fun to work on a project for the station. Whether this be your mad scientist creations to infastructure improvements only you can help improve the station, one weld at a time.

## ![warningsign.png](/jobs/engineering/warningsign.png) Oh shit somethings gone very wrong
When something has made a large part of the station uninhabitable it is your job to return it to normalcy as soon as humanly possible.
### "Maxcap detonated at bridge!!"
Your #1 priority is to seal the breach and stop more atmosphere from venting into the great expanse. Explosions or other occurances that can destroy large parts of the station will cause damages to other systems (Power, Pipenets, Disposals) these systems are to be disregarded until the hole is no longer a hole. 
Once the massive gap in the station is plugged you should start returning the section back to conditions that humans(or others) find quite plesant. 
### "Plasma fire medbay!!"
Plasma fires are extrodinarly dangerous as they sap the oxygen from the air, generate heats that not even your engineering hardsuit can handle, and burn everything to a crisp. When fighting fires you should do actively breach the rooms the fire is occuring in. Your hardsuit can survive space, but not a 10000K fire. Other equipments such as fire extinguishers, holofans from atmos, and the scrubbers can be used to assist in putting out a fire. Atmos techs are usually more suited to fire fighting but are uncommon. After a fire is put out refer to breach repairs.
###  "Why am I green?"
The hardest to fix disaster are nuclear in nature, there arent many things you can do to fix massive contamination besides deconstructing and securing irradiated objects to prevent further exposure. **Your hardsuit is only partialy radiation proof, use a radsuit.** Thankfully radiation disasters are rare, but always be prepared.
## ![doubleagent.gif](/jobs/engineering/doubleagent.gif) Thank god we have escalation.
Traitor engineers have now the reason to subject the station to the most torturous experience they've had in a while. **Remember escalation exists, yes we know you can singulo delam in 10 minutes. Go for it if you want to eat a ban.** 
Traitor engineers do not have much access to any great personal weapons but more mass destruction of the station. It is your job to not go overboard, as it is very easy as an engineer.
- most station crew will not mind an engineer doing work in their areas, this gives an authority for being in places if the room is damaged or being worked on, abuse this to get to places you need to be in. Being suspicous will get you the boot as this authority is not real. Your tolerated, not allowed.
- A very dirty trick to save yourself some TC is to attach a signaler to the telecomms APC, deactivate Tcomms whenever you need!
- Flamethrowers can have their tanks pressurized to belch out excess plasma, this can quickly render a room uninhabitable to most crew, use this sparingly as the admins wont tolerate pyromania without a good reason.
- The engine being loosed/Delaminated will warrent a shuttle call 9/10, use this as a last ditch if you need to escape.
