GUIDE TO GEOTHERMAL POWER: (AKA OSHAN POWER)
Step one, grab the following, 1x dowsing rod, 1x geothermal capture vent, 1x stomper unit (needs to be dragged), 1x pickaxe/proto kinetic accelerator, all the industrial grade cables (atleast 5 coils, print them at your departmental lathe), 1x trench map, 1x toolbelt with your tools, 1x modsuit/hardsuit, 1x internals.
Step two, equip your exosuit and turn your internals on. 
Step three, look at the trench map, you will see a map which has a few red squares that overlay certain areas on the map. these are the areas that have your geothermal vents, or what you'll be using to generate power. Make your way over to one of those squares and use the dowsing rod on the ground, it will either say that there is no geyser in range, or it will say something like, 8m Northwest, if there is no geyser in range, and you're inside the red box, walk a bit, then try the dowsing rod again. You may need the pickaxe to dig over to the geyser.
Step four, when you have found the geyser, the dousing rod will say that it is directly above the geyser, drag the stomper unit directly adjacent to the tile the geyser is on, and wrench it down. Then, activate the stomper with an empty hand, this will PIN the geyser which prevents it from moving from where it is pinned. 
Step five, bring a line of industrial cables from where the geyser is all the way over to the external cables by one of the windows east of engineering, this will take time. 
Step six, use the geothermal capture vent in your bag on the tile where the geyser is, and then use a crowbar on the placed vent. Using a wrench will instead allow you to repickup the geothermal capture vent. 
Congrats, you now have ~400 KW of power.
