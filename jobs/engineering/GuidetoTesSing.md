## Description 
The Singularity and tesla are Nanotrassen's old but much more deadly sources of powering the entire station. Many stations have either been turned to dust or erased entirely by one of these getting loose for any odd reasons. Its your job to not let that happen, while still extracting as much juice as you can from them.


## ![warningsign.png](/jobs/engineering/warningsign.png) The Setup
Both engines have a similar setup but with key differences that would either make them useless or destructive to the station. 
### ![moth_lamp.gif](/jobs/engineering/moth_lamp.gif) The Tesla
The Tesla ball is a giant ball of pure electricity that sends massive bolts of lightning every couple of seconds. The main danger of this engine is that it will ruthlesly destroy any piece of technology if let alowed to escape and get away from grounding rods. Yet this engine is safer, as it cannot destroy its containment on its own if setup correctly.
### ![scrungularity.png](/jobs/engineering/scrungularity.png) The ~~Scrung~~ Singularity
The Singularity is a black hole. Yes quite literally a black hole that has its decay via hawking radiation harvested for station power. It is much more dangerous then the tesla as you can only shield and not absorb radiation, it can break itself out of containment even with it properly setup, and wont produce as much power. 
## Enough talking, more doing.
So thankfully these engines are fairly easy to setup, and much faster then a SM if done from scratch. 
### material requirements
For either engine you will need atleast.
- 1 Particle Accelerator (Purchase from cargo)
- 1 generator Tesla/Singulo
- 4 Field Generators (Cargo or secure storage)
- 2 Emitters (Secure, cargo, or make them)
- some starting power generator (Pacman works)
### ![field_generator.gif](/jobs/engineering/field_generator.gif) Basic containment
First you will need to arange the field generators in a rectangular shape, this also includes squares. A singulo needs atleast a 3x3 of space on the inside but teslas can do fine with 1x1. The field generators need to be wrenched then welded like an emitter.
After the field generators are placed you will need to put an emitter on oposite corners and secure them as you would a field generator. Make sure these have a powered cable under them or they will not engage and power the field generators.
Once you've gotten your containment ready you can put either your singulo or tesla generator in and start containment. This is as simple as clicking on the field gens and emitters, you will see the emitters fire at the field gens and after a short period the field gens will activate, blue lines will connect to the other generators and a blue field will go over the area it encloses, if you see this, its contained
### ![pa.png](/jobs/engineering/pa.png) The PA
The particle accelerator is what actually makes your engines start. When you have this engine round start it should already be aligned in the proper manner, if you get it from a crate align it as show in the image. 
Once that is done you need to wrench, the wire, then screwdriver every peice. Make sure the room is powered!
Click on the computer for the PA to turn it on, setting 0 will make sure the engine does not decay, 1 will slowly make it grow, and 2 will make it grow at a modest pace.
If your feeling bad ass you can hack the computer to allow a power level of 3. The tried and true method is to pulse every wire twice untill you get the one that whirs, then cut that wire.
### ![lady_tesla.gif](/jobs/engineering/lady_tesla.gif) Tesla specific
The Tesla is by far an easier engine to manage. to collect power you must put down tesla-coils and grounding rods to collect energy and disipate excess. After that you can crank the PA to maximum and leave the tesla alone.
The more balls orbiting the main tesla the more power the tesla has, try to get a ton!
### ![lord_singulo.gif](/jobs/engineering/lord_singulo.gif) Singulo specific
Singularities are complicated beasts as taming a blackhole is quite difficult. the Singularity has 5 stages of ever increasing doom. 
- tier 1 is a 1x1, it bearly pulls and can only destroy tiles it moves over
- tier 2 has now become a 2x2 and can pull up tiles surounding it, this is one of the safe levels for power generation
- tier 3 is a 3x3 and the maximum you should be at, it has started atracting a purple hue and can pull alot farther, magboots recomended.
- tier 4 has become a 5x5 and can no longer be contained, it can detach welded objects (Like field generators) and has a large pulling area.
- tier 5 is truely massive and has created a bright yellow accresion disk. May god have mercy apon those who see it.
Starting off you need to put down radiation collectors to collect the radiation. these need a tank of plasma inside of them and then activated by clicking, this plasma will be slowly converted to tritium so it will need replacing every so often. 
When the singulo is either tier 2 or 3 you must turn the PA to level 0 or suffer the fate of every station before yours.
## ""SINGU/TESLOOSE!!!""
So were fucked. Or are we? Theres 2 things to do against both engines, the 1 that works against both is to use a SRN, it is a rocket launcher located in both the CE and RD lockers, its a one shot use so aim carefully. 
For diminishing the danger of the tesla you can build a load of grounding rods around safety areas, it will stop the tesla from frying everything there. Note that the tesla will still dust anyone who comes in contact with the main ball.
In a last ditch attempt to stop the Singularity the clown can be thrown into it for a 50/50 chance of either shrinking or growing it a level, note that it cannot fully destroy a singularity past level 2.
