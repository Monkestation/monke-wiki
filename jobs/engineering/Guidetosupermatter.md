# Guide to the Suermatter

|                             | ENGINEERING GUIDES                                                                                 |
|-----------------------|
|![sm_meta.png](/jobs/engineering/sm_meta.png) <br>Roundstart Meta SM | **Warning:** The Supermatter is a birght yellow crystal of slaughter and destruction. If you walk into it on roundstart you will be **banned**.

## Description 
The Supermatter is a unstable hyper-reactive crystal that when injected with energy, provides a great deal more back in the form of radiation and electric shocks.
Whats good about this new form of power over older engines is that it is alot harder to cause it to explode or "Delaminate." Which is the correct term.


## ![warningsign.png](/jobs/engineering/warningsign.png) The Setup
The SM is alot more complicated in setting up compared to the Tesla and Singularity. Steps should be taken to double check and secure the setup as there are many more points of failure.
### ![supermatter_shard.png](/jobs/engineering/supermatter_shard.png) The Crystal
The SM on roundstart should be in a fully enclosed space with more then 90% of the work done for you! This means its harder to fuck up right? **Wrong.** Once again you must pay close attention, while the SM can be started even within 1 minute of the shift starting you need to know how to make it work.
The basic workings of generating power from the SM is that while it will generate more energy then what was put in, it will generate alot of this energy as heat. The setup's job is to export this heat away from the SM as it is actively turning coolant gasses into very dangerous, different gasses. The guide will later show what gasses do what but the most common is N2->O2->Plasma. We all know what happens when heat, plasma, and O2 mix together.
## Time to handle this thing.

### material requirements
For Round start setup you will need
- 1 Pair of Meson goggles
- 1 RPD (Rapid Pipe Dispenser)
|                             | The Loop                                                                                 |
|-----------------------|
|![sm_meta.png](/jobs/engineering/sm_meta.png) <br>Our example. | Starting off notice how there are alot of pumps segmenting the loop? **This is bad. The Golden rule of the Supermatter is that pumps bad, pipes good.** The reason why is explained later, just for now the only pump you want is the gas filter between the red pipenet and blue pipenet.

 
### The Classic
This tutorial on how to tame the SM will use the most clasic setup using N2 or nitrogen gas to cool the SM
| The Classic Part 1
|-----------------------|
|![sm_part_1.png](/jobs/engineering/sm_part_1.png) <br> Pumps bad.| ![sm_part_2.png](/jobs/engineering/sm_part_2.png) <br> Pipes good! Remove the bypass entirely. 

 |The Classic Part 2|
||
|![sm_part_1.png](/jobs/engineering/sm_part_3.png) <br> Filters and Pumps bad.| ![sm_part_2.png](/jobs/engineering/sm_part_4.png) <br> Use layer connectors for upgrade potential. 
 |The Classic Part 3|
||
|![sm_part_1.png](/jobs/engineering/sm_part_5.png) <br> The pumps arent good either| ![sm_part_2.png](/jobs/engineering/sm_part_6.png) <br> So we replace with more pipes!
 |The Classic Part 4|
||
|![sm_part_1.png](/jobs/engineering/sm_part_7.png) <br> Wrench the N2 Tanks and turn on those pumps, they're good.| ![sm_part_2.png](/jobs/engineering/sm_part_8.png) <br> Go to the air alarm next to the SM. Vent controls should be like this.
 |The Classic Part 5|
||
|![sm_part_1.png](/jobs/engineering/sm_part_9.png) <br> Now set the scrubbers.| ![sm_part_2.png](/jobs/engineering/sm_part_10.png) <br> Finally after every other step is done, start the power generation!  

Good job! you just started a Supermatter! Now get the hell out of there as the SM has been started by the emitter fire and will produce radiation.

## Gas interactions
The supermatter will influence and get influenced by the various gases in the SM, the reason roundstart uses N2 is because it does not boost the SM in any way and is decent at keeping it cool.
Here is every interacting gas and what it will do
| Gas    | Danger |Description |Notables |Effects |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| ![hyper_nob.png](/jobs/engineering/hyper_nob.png)  <br> Hyper-nobelium   | -100%       |Stops gas reactions (Like fires) when more then 5 moles are present per tile. Decreases waste output of SM and Increases power gen a bit. | - Effectively stops waste production <br> - 1 part of resonance cascade |- Power Transmission +30% <br> - Waste Multiplier -1400% <Br> - Heat Power Gen -100%|
| ![helium.png](/jobs/engineering/helium.png) <br> Helium  | -100%       |Completely non reactive gas to cool the SM |None |N/A |
| ![freon.png](/jobs/engineering/freon.png) <br> Freon  | -50%  | When the SM gasses become 30% freon power transmission will stop. This will cause the SM to rapidly cool, also has a higher heat capacity then plasma so great for absorbing heat. When very cool it will turn into hot ice which can cause a plasma fire if not handled with caution.|Great at cooling, can become disasterous if not managed |- Power Transmission -300% <br> - Waste Multiplier -900% <br> - Heat Powergain -100% |
| ![protonitr.png](/jobs/engineering/protonitr.png) <br> Proto-Nitrate  | -30%        | This gas is just a good worker. Increases power generation while adding heat resistance to the SM. It will also make more power at the higher heats you can now achive! |No Downsides. | - Power Transmission +150% <br> - Waste Multiplier -400% <br> - Heat Resistance +400% (You can have the SM on fire and be fine) <br> - Heat Powergain +100% |
| ![n2.png](/jobs/engineering/n2.png) <br> Nitrogen  | 0% (baseline)        | Nitrogen gas is your run of the mill safe gas for long term SM use. Even hampers plasma generation from the sm! | Abundant and safe! |- Waste Multiplier -250% <br> - Heat Powergain -100% |
| ![pluox.png](/jobs/engineering/pluox.png) <br> Pluoxium | 0%        | This gas while useful for internals mainly distrupts CO2 SMs by canceling out any benefits of CO2, then acts like Nitrogen. Get it out of your SM asap. | A worse Nitrogen |- Power transmission -50% <br> - Waste Multiplier -150% <br> - Heat Powergain -100% |
