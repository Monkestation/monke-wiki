# Guide to the Suermatter

|                             | ENGINEERING GUIDES                                                                                 |
|-----------------------|
|![sm_meta.png](/jobs/engineering/sm_meta.png) <br>Roundstart Meta SM | **Warning:** The Supermatter is a birght yellow crystal of slaughter and destruction. If you walk into it on roundstart you will be **banned**.

## Description 
The Supermatter is a unstable hyper-reactive crystal that when injected with energy, provides a great deal more back in the form of radiation and electric shocks.
Whats good about this new form of power over older engines is that it is alot harder to cause it to explode or "Delaminate." Which is the correct term.


## ![warningsign.png](/jobs/engineering/warningsign.png) The Setup
The SM is alot more complicated in setting up compared to the Tesla and Singularity. Steps should be taken to double check and secure the setup as there are many more points of failure.
### ![supermatter_shard.png](/jobs/engineering/supermatter_shard.png) The Crystal
The SM on roundstart should be in a fully enclosed space with more then 90% of the work done for you! This means its harder to fuck up right? **Wrong.** Once again you must pay close attention, while the SM can be started even within 1 minute of the shift starting you need to know how to make it work.
The basic workings of generating power from the SM is that while it will generate more energy then what was put in, it will generate alot of this energy as heat. The setup's job is to export this heat away from the SM as it is actively turning coolant gasses into very dangerous, different gasses. The guide will later show what gasses do what but the most common is N2->O2->Plasma. We all know what happens when heat, plasma, and O2 mix together.
## Time to handle this thing.

### material requirements
For Round start setup you will need
- 1 Pair of Meson goggles
- 1 RPD (Rapid Pipe Dispenser)
|                             | The Loop                                                                                 |
|-----------------------|
|![sm_meta.png](/jobs/engineering/sm_meta.png) <br>Our example. | Starting off notice how there are alot of pumps segmenting the loop? **This is bad. The Golden rule of the Supermatter is that pumps bad, pipes good.** The reason why is explained later, just for now the only pump you want is the gas filter between the red pipenet and blue pipenet.

 
### The Classic
This tutorial on how to tame the SM will use the most clasic setup using N2 or nitrogen gas to cool the SM
