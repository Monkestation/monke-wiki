# Guide to Paperwork
Imagine needing to write a guide / samples page of ingame paperwork markdown all in markdown! How meta!

In either case, paper markdown is similar to how markdown works.

First off, you need some stuff:

- Pen
You have one on your PDA, you can also find black/blue and even red ones lying around.
- Crayons
Always bolded, no list, horizontal rule or small tags functions.

To write on paper, just click on it with said tools and type away. Thankfully, if you already know markdown, most of this is familiar. Discord uses Markdown in some format, and this wiki is also 99% Markdown as well! You can refer to [the markdown cheat sheet](https://markdownguide.offshoot.io/cheat-sheet/) right here!

Bold: Just throw `**Bold Text**.` some stars around it and you're good.
Italics: Just throw `*Italics text.*` a single star around it and you're good to go.
Code blocks: Code blocks is as simple as the \` Grave symbol next to the 1 on your keyboard on either side of something and it'll generate a block.
Strikethrough: Just put down `~Strikethrough~` squigilies around it.
Centering Text: Just do html tags for this, specifically `<center></center>` to center the text.
Horizontal rules: Fancy line. Just do `___` between lines.
Signatures: You must use a `%s` but it has to be done in a fillable field, just below.
Fillable Fields: Do `[ ________________ ]`, with each _ being a character slot. You can put your signatures in these blocks. Signatures can't be faked since they're their own font!
Headers: It's as simple as `#`, add more `#` to do lower teired headers.
Tables: Markdown tables take a bit more to show than what we can quickly put on the page. Refer to the cheat sheet above for it.
Lists: Use `-` at the start of an item, tab over if you need sub items!
Numbered lists: Just number things as you go and it'll format it.
Task list: This one's a fun one. Just do `- [ ]` to setup checkboxes. The checkboxes can't be edited after saving, but it does make for some pretty funny paperwork.

Ready to use forms:

TBD because of how Markdown wiki works...
