# Standard Operating Procedure
This page details the expectations of what all personnel aboard Monkestation is to do during a number of events that may occur over the course of a shift. Not all possible events that occur will be discussed but this will give you a level of "minimum expectations" so that all personnel can be on the same page when disrupting events occur.

# Alert Levels
## <font color="green">Code Green - All Clear</font>

Standard operating level. No immediate or clear threat to the station. All departments may carry out work as normal.

- Suit sensors are not required to be on.
- Weapons worn by security are to be hidden except when in the case of an emergency.
- Crew members may freely walk in the hallways.
- AI/Cyborgs have no need to bolt down any secure areas.
- Security must respect the privacy of crew members and no unauthorized searches are allowed.

## <font color="blue">Code Blue - Confirmed Threat</font>

Elevated alert level. There are reports or other proof available to indicate that there is a threat to the station. When a Centcom threat summary is received and printed at communication consoles (happens automatically every roundstart), the blue alert level is applied.

- Suit sensors are mandatory, but coordinate positions are not required.
- Security may have weapons visible.
- Crew members may be searched by security with probable cause.
- AI/Cyborgs may bolt down high secure areas.
- Energy guns, laser guns and riot gear are allowed to be given out to security personnel if the HoS or Warden agree.

## <font color="red">Code Red - Immediate Threat</font>

Maximum alert level. There is an immediate threat to the station or severe damage. Martial Law is in effect.

- Suit sensors are to be turned fully on at all times.
- Security can raid departments and arrest any crew member deemed a threat to the station.
- All crew members must remain in their departments.
- AI/Cyborgs may bolt down maintenance and airlocks leading to space.

## <font color="pink">Code Delta - Imminent Destruction</font>

The station's self destruct mechanism has been engaged due to overwhelming threat to the station. Martial Law is in effect.

- Suit sensors are to be turned fully on at all times.
- All orders from Heads of Staff and Security must be followed, any disobedience is punishable by death.
- All crew members are to evacuate immediately, if possible.

# Different Situations

## Evacuation

- All personnel are to evacuate on the escape pods or the emergency shuttle, which Central Command sends.
- All personnel are required to assist with evacuation. All crew must be evacuated, regardless of their consciousness.
- Prisoners are to be brought to the secure area of the escape shuttle, except for prisoners who pose a severe threat.
- AI units may be brought to Central Command on portable card devices (InteliCards) if structural failure is likely or AI units wish to leave.
- Mechs and Cyborg units are to be hauled to the escape shuttle for Central Command to inspect.
- Authorizing early shuttle launches is not allowed unless there is an immediate threat to shuttle integrity.

## Fire and Other Environmental Hazards

- Immediate evacuation of all untrained personnel.
- Fire alarms to be used to control the hazard.
- Atmospheric Technicians and Station Engineers are to remove the hazard.
- Pump air back into the area when fixed.
- Ensure the damage is repaired.

## Radiation Storm

- All crew to move to the maintenance tunnels.
- Wait a while until it's safe to move again, and continue your business. Report to Medbay if you're feeling strange.
- Medbay staff should be ready to administer mutadone to the ones who got caught in the storm.

## Viral Outbreak

- If a severe viral strain is on board the station, the Chief Medical Officer is required to quarantine infected parts of the station with the help of security.
- All infected crew are to be isolated in Virology or Medbay.
- Sterile masks/Internals and gloves are mandatory for medical personnel and recommended for crew.
- Quarantine must be maintained until the outbreak is contained and resolved.
- If the Emergency Shuttle is called, medical and security are to ensure no infected crew board the shuttle.

## Meteor Storm

- All crew to move to central parts of the station.
- Damage is to be repaired by engineering personnel after the threat has passed.
- Shuttle must be called if the station becomes unsalvageable.

## Extraterrestrial Takeover

- Station Command is to prevent infection from spreading to Central Command by ensuring the emergency shuttle is not called until the threat is contained or terminated.
- Destroy all extraterrestrial sources on the station.
- Round up all forms of extraterrestrial lifeforms and contain or terminate them.
- If extraterrestrial forces cannot be defeated, arm and detonate the Nuclear Fission Explosive to ensure their suppression.

# Personnel

These are expectations of individual crew or departments as appropriate.

## Captain

- Get dat fukken disk.
- Don't fukken die with dat fukken disk.
- You are the last one on the station that should be handling a situation. If there is someone else available that is appropriate, they should be the ones handling it.
- If a Department Head is failing to handle situations in their departments to the best of their ability, you may demote said department heads within reason. Provide a copy of the arrest warrant to CentCom for documentation.

## All Department Heads

- Demote personnel that are not meeting your or Nanotrasen's expectations of conduct. Demotion is by firing the ID card to strip it of its trim and its permissions.
- Manage your department. If something happens and it was your departments responsibility, failure to uphold this shall result in **you** being responsible for it. (ie. Genetecist handing out mutations without proper clearances, such as Hulk).
- If you, the department heads, feel that the Captain is not doing their job, you are to explain this, in writing, to CentCom via Fax with signatures. Refer to Space Law regarding arrests of Heads or Captain.
- You may use security powers in order to handle law and order on the station. However, once you have made the active decision in doing so, you **must** follow Space Law in its entirety. If not, anyone that you bust may request an appeal for their alleged wrongdoing and can result in a very lengthy, if not mandatory, court proceeding depending on the severity of misconduct. Severe cases of misconduct will result in a demotion to Clown.

## Assistants

- Your job is to assist other positions, get your space legs, learn how to use your hands, etc. Greytiding is a punishable offense, so don't do it. Even better, get a job from the HOP as they will know what is in need and can get you setup on something that is helpful to the station as a whole. Who knows, you might learn something that you actually wanna do.

## Chief Engineer

- Your first priority will be to ensure that the station is structurally sound.
- Your second priority will be to ensure that the station has sufficient power.
- To reiterate an above point, you're responsible for engineering and its personnel.

## Research Director

- Given how large and wide the Science department can be, making use of your cameras may allow you to be able to review all of the operations in the department.
- Xenobio should be getting authorization to conduct any operations that isn't feeding and breeding slimes.
- Robotics can issue mechs to those that request it, but if there's not a "good reason" for a mech to be given out, you're absolutely fine to reject a request for a mech.

## Head of Security

- You're below the CE in Chain of Command. You've got better things to deal with than command related issues anyway.
- Read and understand Space Law. If there's questions or you need clarification, ask.
- You're the Warden if there is no Warden.

## Head of Personnel

- Your PDA also can act as the same as the terminal in your office if you don't need anything in there to handle a request. Remember, it is all just requests. You can reject any request from any non-Head if you feel that the request is unreasonable.
