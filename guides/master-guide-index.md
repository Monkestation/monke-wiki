# The Guides
> Here lives the guide table! If it exists, it's linked here. If it's listed but not linked, it's not added to the wiki yet! If it doesn't exist at all, it might be because we haven't thought of it yet! Feel free to lettuce know what you wanna see!

> Ignore the contents of the Development portion of the table until we decide what we actually want there. The rest of this should be fine to develop on!
