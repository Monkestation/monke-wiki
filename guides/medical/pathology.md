# Important Information
> Living mice contain viruses, so no need to kill them its useful to keep them to breed them to have a steady source of virus dishes, using a syringe on a mouse will get some of the infected blood.
{.is-info}

> Wear a Bio-Suit. Contact diseases spread like wildfire just touching items can spread it, wear a bio suit or you and everything you hold dear will become infected.
{.is-warning}

> Turning on science goggles by using them In hand will turn on virus viewing, this is super helpful for seeing who and whats infected
{.is-info}

> Chemistry's job is no longer to cure viruses its now entirely up to you the pathologist.
{.is-warning}

# Why?

# Major Changes
1. Chemistry no longer cures viruses directly, they can help with chemicals like spaceacillian, but vaccines are made by the pathologist.
2. Spacemen now have Immune Systems which directly interact with diseases.
3. Diseases now have 2 specific Antigens that are needed to Cure them.
4. Health Scanners no longer reveal diseases, thats handled by the Antibody Scanner.
5. Living mice have and can pass around diseases, its no longer just eating dead mice.
# Disease spread types and you
| Image | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|![image.png](/image.png) | Blood Contact | Blood pools, Injecting blood, bloodied items, bloodied surgery tools, ingesting blood, eating infected meats.|
|![screenshot_2023-12-07_134128.png](/screenshot_2023-12-07_134128.png) | Skin Contact | Touching items and mobs will spread the disease.|
|![screenshot_2023-12-07_135239.png](/screenshot_2023-12-07_135239.png) |Airborne Spread | Breathing these clouds in will spread it, infection chance increases lifespan of clouds.|

# Machines

## Disease Incubator
The disease incubator as the name implies incubates diseases.
![screenshot_2023-12-07_140534.png](/screenshot_2023-12-07_140534.png)
Growth is how much our virus dish has grown, at 100% it can be analyzed
Volume is the amount of reagents inside the virus dish.
The Mutate variables are how much the dishes symptoms are mutated every process

> Virus Food increases dish and virus growth, water on the other hand lowers growth and lowers multipliers.
{.is-info}


## Disease Splicer
The disease is made up of a few parts
![screenshot_2023-12-07_140733.png](/screenshot_2023-12-07_140733.png)
1. Disease Dish, when its inserted you use the Targeted Stage and extract effect to extract that specific effect
2. Memory Bank, thats the current stored symptom. It can be burned to a disk to save for later like botany's plant DNA disk

> If a disease isn't analyzed the symptom extracted will show as unknown, so make sure to analyze the disease.
{.is-info}

Using the symptom in your memory bank you can burn the symptom onto the disease as the target stage.

> You do not need to burn it into the same stage you took it from, you can have a disease with 4 of the same symptom.
{.is-info}

## Centrifuge
> Unlike other machines the centrifuges processing speed is entirely dependant on the vial count and volumes of the vials, it performs best with all vials having the same reagent count.
{.is-info}

The centrifuge if where you create vaccines, you can also isolate a specific virus from a blood sample.
To make a vaccine the blood sample in question needs to have a certain amount of the specific antigen in the blood, the amount of time to create the vaccine varies greatly and if at low concentrations can take upwards of 20 minutes to create a vaccine.

## Disease Analyzer
This machine only analyzes diseases, it requires the dish to be 100% grown so you may need to use the incubator. After doing so it will attach a label to the dish that when examined will give details about the virus, aswell as adding it to the Database. That looks like this.

> Changes made to the virus will not auto update you will need to re-analyze the virus for the effects to update in the database.
{.is-warning}

## Pathogenic Isolator
The pathogenic isolator creates a virus dish out of a blood sample. Thats about it.
