# Important Information
> Living mice contain viruses, so no need to kill them its useful to keep them to breed them to have a steady source of virus dishes, using a syringe on a mouse will get some of the infected blood.
{.is-info}

> Wear a Bio-Suit. Contact diseases spread like wildfire just touching items can spread it, wear a bio suit or you and everything you hold dear will become infected.
{.is-warning}

> Turning on science goggles by using them In hand will turn on virus viewing, this is super helpful for seeing who and whats infected
{.is-info}

> Chemistry's job is no longer to cure viruses its now entirely up to you the pathologist.
{.is-warning}

# Why?

# Major Changes
1. Chemistry no longer cures viruses directly, they can help with chemicals like spaceacillian, but vaccines are made by the pathologist.
2. Spacemen now have Immune Systems which directly interact with diseases.
3. Diseases now have 2 specific Antigens that are needed to Cure them.
4. Health Scanners no longer reveal diseases, thats handled by the Antibody Scanner.
5. Living mice have and can pass around diseases, its no longer just eating dead mice.

# How to Virus
> First things first, you are going to want to find some infected blood, late joins and mice have these. To see whos infected turn on your science goggles and refer the the disease spread types and you to see whos infected
{.is-info}

> Expect to be tried as a war criminal if you make your disease airborne spread, for good viruses blood spread is what you want.
{.is-warning}

> Bring the blood sample back to your lab and throw it into the centrifuge and isolate this may take some time, so its best advised to go find more diseases in the mean time.
{.is-info}

> Bring the disease to the incbuator after giving it some virus food to grow, afterwards bring it to the analyzer to analyze it
{.is-info}

> You now have an analyzed disease, it splits into two sections from here. Modification and Curing.
{.is-success}

## Modification
> You will need a sample of this virus for every symptom you want to extract, using a syringe on the virus dish will let you get 2 syringes of blood out of it.
{.is-info}

{.is-warning}

> Take the symptoms you want out of the virus using the splicer and create some disease disks for later.

> Using the disease we want to spread slot the symptoms into the stage you want.

> Incubating the disease will raise or lower its strength robustness and infectability
{.is-info}

> If you aren't an antag re-analyze your virus so its in the database and medical knows what it is, or you will have a mob at your door
{.is-warning}

> You've now made a virus, and are ready to release it into the world!
{.is-success}

## Curing
In the virus label there will be something called the virus antigens, if you are using the Antibody Scanner it will look like this.
![asdas.png](/asdas.png)
> Each notch represts a stage in the virus hitting each notch means that stage won't trigger, IE: the first notch is the first symptom.

Assuming the virus is analyzed you will see the notches over antigens those are what is needed to cure the virus.

> If you just see a line its not analyzed and will need to be analyzed
{.is-info}

You will need to raise the antigens to the topmost line in order to cure it, there are a few ways to do this.
1. Vaccines
2. Medication
3. Rest
4. Burn it
5. Chicken Noodle Soup

Medication is spaceacillian and other antipathogenics.
Chicken Noodle Soup acts as a really low level anti-pathogenic so it most likely won't cure anything except low level viruses.

> Its advised to raise your antigens to a certain point like 35-45 and than getting virology to create a vaccine, this wont take nearly as long and will help cure other people aswell.

> If you followed any of the steps before this you should have cured the disease, but be careful other diseases will lower antigens, and can make you vulnerable to this disease again!

# Machines

## Disease Incubator
The disease incubator as the name implies incubates diseases.
![screenshot_2023-12-07_140534.png](/screenshot_2023-12-07_140534.png)
Growth is how much our virus dish has grown, at 100% it can be analyzed
Volume is the amount of reagents inside the virus dish.
The Mutate variables are how much the dishes symptoms are mutated every process

> Virus Food increases dish and virus growth, water on the other hand lowers growth and lowers multipliers.
{.is-info}


## Disease Splicer
The disease is made up of a few parts
![screenshot_2023-12-07_140733.png](/screenshot_2023-12-07_140733.png)
1. Disease Dish, when its inserted you use the Targeted Stage and extract effect to extract that specific effect
2. Memory Bank, thats the current stored symptom. It can be burned to a disk to save for later like botany's plant DNA disk

> If a disease isn't analyzed the symptom extracted will show as unknown, so make sure to analyze the disease.
{.is-info}

Using the symptom in your memory bank you can burn the symptom onto the disease as the target stage.

> You do not need to burn it into the same stage you took it from, you can have a disease with 4 of the same symptom.
{.is-info}

## Centrifuge
> This is the machine that you should be getting virus dishes from its faster than the isolator can do four at once and can be upgraded.
{.is-warning}

> Unlike other machines the centrifuges processing speed is entirely dependant on the vial count and volumes of the vials, it performs best with all vials having the same reagent count.
{.is-info}

The centrifuge if where you create vaccines, you can also isolate a specific virus from a blood sample.
To make a vaccine the blood sample in question needs to have a certain amount of the specific antigen in the blood, the amount of time to create the vaccine varies greatly and if at low concentrations can take upwards of 20 minutes to create a vaccine.

## Disease Analyzer
This machine only analyzes diseases, it requires the dish to be 100% grown so you may need to use the incubator. After doing so it will attach a label to the dish that when examined will give details about the virus, aswell as adding it to the Database. That looks like this.
![screenshot_2023-12-07_141925.png](/screenshot_2023-12-07_141925.png)

> Changes made to the virus will not auto update you will need to re-analyze the virus for the effects to update in the database.
