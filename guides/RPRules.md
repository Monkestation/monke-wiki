# RP Rules and Guides

## Creating an RP character

The soul of SS13 lies in being more of a one-shot D&D session than a game of Warhammer. That is to say that the primary focus of the game should be the journey, not necessarily whether you win or lose, or whether or not you make it back alive (or as the same person you started the round with!)

Just like a tabletop Roleplaying Game, SS13 requires a bit of, well, role play. Monkestation itself has no minimum character roleplay requirements, but building a character that you play as can give yourself interesting constraints to play within, as well as make the game more interesting for the people you interact with.

This can seem pretty overwhelming if you don't consider yourself the most creative, but that's okay! You don't have to be exceptionally creative to make an RP character. You don't even need a 25 page back story with all of your characters wants, fears, and needs encapsulated in an encyclopedia. The beauty of round based experiences like SS13 is that you can develop your character's story as you play them, making any interaction or event canon to that character's lore, or an integral piece of information that motivates them.



## High Level Character Archetypes to Kickstart Your Character Creation

The self-insert: There's nothing wrong with just plopping yourself into a game. In fact, some of the most memorable characters are self-inserts. Because what do you know better than yourself? For a self insert, you don't even have to fully place a carbon copy of yourself into the game, you can instead take some bits of your personality and exaggerate them.

The shameless rip-off: Another easy way to make a character is to just take a character you like from other media and insert them into space. An established character already has the groundwork for motivations and typically how they'd react to new things.

The straight-man: This is an incredibly common character archetype in media, and works in any situation. The key to the straight man is to justâ€¦ react to the surroundings as if they are in fact, not normal at all.

## What is RP?

Roleplay (RP) is a creative and immersive form of interactive storytelling within the gaming world, where players assume the personas of fictional characters and actively engage with the game environment and each other. Unlike conventional gameplay, RP transcends mere strategic decisions or objectives, focusing instead on the authentic portrayal of characters with distinct personalities, backgrounds, and motivations. It is a collaborative venture, weaving a tapestry of narratives that evolve dynamically based on the characters' interactions, choices, and the unfolding events within the game. RP adds depth, emotional resonance, and a shared sense of storytelling to the gaming experience, transforming virtual worlds into vibrant and living landscapes of imaginative exploration.

## What constitutes RP?

Consistent Behavior:
- Develop a clear understanding of your character's personality, values, and motivations.
- Consider how your character would respond to various situations and make choices accordingly.
- Avoid sudden, drastic changes in behavior unless there's a compelling in-character reason for it.

Interactions:
- Actively observe and respond to the actions of other characters in your vicinity.
- Initiate conversations with fellow players, exploring different aspects of your character's background or current situation.
- Utilize the in-game environment to create dynamic and engaging interactions with other players.
- Engage with both allies and rivals, contributing to the dynamic interplay of relationships that enrich the overall narrative of your character's journey.
- Approach conflicts as opportunities for character development rather than as obstacles to be avoided or flat out overcome with violence.
- Engage in in-character discussions to resolve disputes, allowing for a more immersive and story-driven resolution.

Collaborative Storytelling:
- Embrace unexpected plot twists and events during a round, adapting your character's narrative to incorporate these elements.
- Embrace opportunities for spontaneous interactions and learn more about the characters on the server.
- Engage with other players to create joint storylines or subplots that enhance the overall narrative of the round.
- Consider the long-term impact of your character's actions on the game world and other characters.
- Seek out compromises that align with your character's values and objectives.

## Yes And...
Consider "Yes, And" to build upon the contributions of others and further enrich the collaborative storytelling experience.

- "Yes": This signifies acceptance and agreement. It encourages participants to acknowledge and accept the reality or ideas presented by their fellow collaborators. Instead of dismissing or negating what someone has introduced, saying "Yes" opens the door to collaboration.
- "And": This represents expansion and contribution. After accepting someone else's contribution (the "Yes" part), participants are encouraged to add something new or build upon the existing idea. This fosters a continuous flow of creativity and allows the narrative or scene to evolve organically.

In the context of roleplaying games or collaborative storytelling, applying "Yes, And" means acknowledging and embracing the contributions of other players. When someone introduces an element or idea into the story, responding with "Yes, And" involves accepting that contribution and adding to it, contributing to a richer and more dynamic narrative. It encourages inclusivity, creativity, and a cooperative storytelling experience.

## Help! I’ve never RP’d before!
Embarking on your first roleplaying (RP) adventure can be both exhilarating and a tad overwhelming. Fear not! This guide is here to offer guidance for those new to the RP realm. Here are some tips to help you along your journey.

- Gauge the overall atmosphere of the round and adjust your roleplay style accordingly.
- Be open to participating in both serious and lighthearted roleplay scenarios, contributing to the diverse experiences of different players.
- Experiment with different roleplay approaches to discover what resonates best with you and your fellow players

## Blackout Policy

WIth respect to roleplay, this will also help to serve what things you remember during certain situations so that the playing field is as fair as possible.

With respect to death and revival, there are going to be some expectations of how far you remember. The method of revival will help determine what you will remember. We'll start with the most restrictive memory requirements up to the least restrictive.

| Method | Memory Limit |
|---|---|
| Cloning | Up to the most recent clone scan. |
| Normal Revival | Anything up to small details of your death, but not identity of the murderer |
| Antagonist Revivals | No limit |
| Brain on MMI | No limit |

Some specific notes regarding the revivals:

- Certain antagonists have revivals built into their kits such as Changlings, Bloodsuckers and Nightmares, hence the reason for their having zero limit to memory is to help provide that for them.
- Regarding clone-scans, if you're dead when scanned, you still won't remember anything about your death! You just won't!
