# How to Avoid Getting Banned
You ever sit there and go "huh, why did I get banned?" This is the guide for you.

> While this is a relatlively light-hearted article amidst a sea of pretty serious looking ones, it is intended to convey some helpful advice because we really do want people to not get banned for simple stuff.

# Read DA RULEZ

No, seriously. Go [read them](/). The rules are pretty clear cut in most, if not, every case. Ignorance of the rules doesn't save you from getting The Hammer of Justice straight to the face. (bwoink)

# AHELP is your friend

If you are not sure if something you are doing (or about to do, ideally) is going to break the rules, filing an AHELP with the admins (Admin > Adminhelp) is a great way to start the conversation. It is better to check in and verify what you are doing is kosher before you find yourself on the receiving end of The Hammer of Justice.

# Understanding Escalation

This topic is probably a little more convoluted than others, hence it needs a little bit of an explainer. While the text of Rule 9 may be clear to some, it can be pretty muddy for others.

To help out with the talk of it, if things are going to happen between any two or more people, there has to be clear cut reasons for it. Someone attacked you and you're defending yourself? That's perfectly A-OK! You decide that someone's gotta get roughed up, but you don't got a good IC reason to do it? Entirely NOT ok. That someone decided to shove you and steal your food? Probably OK to shove back and get your food, but going past that could get you in trouble. More so with [station security](/jobs/security/guide-to-shitcurity) than the admins, but if things don't look right... there's no promises.

# More than Just You

Just a simple reminder that there's an awful lot more people than just you playing. Even we admins that have to sit here and go through all the ahelps, mhelps, and other such things. We're just as capable of making mistakes like you do. So just remember the one in the chair somewhere else in space.
