# How to Avoid Getting Banned
You ever sit there and go "huh, why did I get banned?" This is the guide for you.

> While this is a relatlively light-hearted article amidst a sea of pretty serious looking ones, it is intended to convey some helpful advice because we really do want people to not get banned for simple stuff.

# Read DA RULEZ

No, seriously. Go [read them](/). The rules are pretty clear cut in most, if not, every case. Ignorance of the rules doesn't save you from getting The Hammer of Justice straight to the face. (bwoink)

# AHELP is your friend

If you are not sure if something you are doing (or about to do, ideally) is going to break the rules, filing an AHELP with the admins (Admin > Adminhelp) is a great way to start the conversation. It is better to check in and verify what you are doing is kosher before you find yourself on the receiving end of The Hammer of Justice.

# Understanding Escalation

This topic is probably a little more convoluted than others, hence it needs a little bit of an explainer. While the text of Rule 9 may be clear to some, it can be pretty muddy for others.

To help out with the talk of it, if things are going to happen between any two or more people, there has to be clear cut reasons for it. Someone attacked you and you're defending yourself? That's perfectly A-OK! You decide that someone's gotta get roughed up, but you don't got a good IC reason to do it? Entirely NOT ok. That someone decided to shove you and steal your food? Probably OK to shove back and get your food, but going past that could get you in trouble. More so with [station security](/jobs/security/guide-to-shitcurity) than the admins, but if things don't look right... there's no promises.

# Welderbombs

Welderbombs are pretty funny. Welderbombs (or threats of them) can lead to some interesting situations. However, one thing to keep in mind is that if you do go down this path, ensure you've got at least some form of escalation so folk know whats going on and what your intentions are. Standing next to a welder tank with a lit torch is a fast way to get an IC response... and if there's that lack of escalation like above, the admins might get involved. Especially if you mysteriously get blown to pieces in the midst of the explosion.

# The Chef and His Kingdom

A big thing that so many people have just not seem to have gotten through their heads: The Kitchen and the areas encompassing it are the Chef's house. The Chef has Close Quarters Cooking, which allows him to kick your ass six ways from Sunday if you pick a fight with him. Jumping the kitchen counter is a form of escalation. Jumping into said kitchen without even as much as a word to the Chef that you're coming in is a bad idea and will frequently land you in medical. If done a second time, don't be surprised if the Chef beheads you and hands off your head to be installed on a new body...

Same can be said about the Barkeep. They aren't a pushover either and will absolutely kick you out of the bar if you get rowdy. Same idea applies: jump the bar, expect to be served immediately. Usually a busted jaw and maybe a beanbag slug or two buried in you.

# More than Just You

Just a simple reminder that there's an awful lot more people than just you playing. Even we admins that have to sit here and go through all the ahelps, mhelps, and other such things. We're just as capable of making mistakes like you do. So just remember the one in the chair somewhere else in space.
