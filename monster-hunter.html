<h1>Monster Hunters</h1>
<p>The monster hunters are a private military company, travelling from planet to planet fighting wars for the side that pays higher.</p>
<p>A deal was made with an anonymous party to deploy monster hunters into several nanotrasen sectors to hunt down dangerous abominations guised as crewmen. &nbsp;Very little is known about this anonymous contractee</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Weapons</h2>
<p>Hunters receive several loadouts they can choose from to aid with their tasks, these weapons are especially effective against monster creatures; dealing bonus damage to them.</p>
<h3>Darkmoon Greatsword</h3>

<p>With 20 base damage, this sword can also be used to emit a moonlight blast projectile against enemies from afar.</p>
<h3>Hunter's Axe</h3>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.fulp.gg/axe.png"></figure>
<p>25 base damage, this two handed axe deals the largest damage out of its peers and grants a high block chance against enemy attacks.</p>
<h3>Threaded Cane</h3>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.fulp.gg/threadedcane.png"></figure>
<p>15 base damage, this weapon excels at long range combat as it can attack enemies that are up to 2 tiles away from you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>White Rabbits</h2>
<p>Upon your adventure, you will encounter several white rabbits across the station, they can only be seen and perceived by you. They can be located using the red queen's card which you will find in your inventory <a href="https://wiki.fulp.gg/rabbit_interaction.mp4">/rabbit_interaction.mp4&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Interacting with these rabbits can grant you several rewards:</p>
<h3>Hunter's Revolver</h3>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.fulp.gg/revolver.png"></figure>
<p>While it doesn't deal considerable damage, a landed shot will slow down monster enemies to a crawl for 8 seconds to give you a good opportunity to get your licks in. This gun uses a special bloodsilver bullet which you can craft using your own blood. Note that crafting a bullet will deal some damage to you.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Rabbit's Eye</h3>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.fulp.gg/rabbit_eye.png"></figure>
<p>All rabbits you interact with will drop this item. It is used to upgrade your melee weapon, each upgrade granting 7% additional damage. Weapons can be upgraded up to 3 times.</p>
<h3>Rabbit Mask</h3>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.fulp.gg/rabbitmask.png"></figure>
<p>This powerful mask grants flash and spray protection as well as some useful abilities:</p>
<h4>Paradox Jaunt</h4>
<p>A jaunt ability allowing you to move from point A to point B bypassing any solid objects in your way: <a href="https://wiki.fulp.gg/rabbitescapeprison.mp4">/rabbitescapeprison.mp4</a></p>
<p>The rabbit's movements will be translated upon your own body. (moving the rabbit 2 steps to the left moves your original body 2 steps to the left)</p>
<h5>Access to Wonderland</h5>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.fulp.gg/wonderlandhaven.png"></figure>
<p>A safehaven you can catch your breath in, the rabbit's mask grants access to Wonderland. You get 1 minute of peace in Wonderland before you are force-teleported back to the station.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do note these abilities have considerably long cooldowns so they should be used only when necessary! While the rabbit mask provides several combat advantages, wearing it will alert monsters and security alike of your nature so try not wearing it in public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Wonderland</h2>
<p>This will be the main base of your operations, several things can be done while in here to assist you with your hunt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Upgrading your weapon</h3>
<p>Earlier we mentioned that your melee weapon can be upgraded using the rabbit's eye.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.fulp.gg/weaponupgrading.mp4">/weaponupgrading.mp4</a></p>
<p>Place your weapon in its base form upon the altar, then use a rabbit eye on the altar. The eye will be consumed upon use, granting your weapon a 7% increase in damage, it can be upgraded up to 3 times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Blood Fountain</h3>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.fulp.gg/bloodfountain.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>blood from the fountain can be collected using a particular vial you will find in Wonderland, drinking this blood will grant you temporary speed buffs and healing. The vial can only be used one time, until you refill it again during your next visit to Wonderland. It would be wise to only drink from this vial when in a skirmish and the odds seem against you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Winning</h2>
<p>Winning only requires you to hunt down the monsters you are tasked with killing, however…</p>
<p>the ‘’secret'' bonus ending is unlocked by killing your tasked monsters AND finding all 5 rabbits scattered across the station.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Secret Ending</h3>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:29%;"><img src="https://wiki.fulp.gg/wonderlandinvasion.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-right" style="width:24.1%;"><img src="https://wiki.fulp.gg/wonderlandinvasion2.png"></figure>
<p>Upon triggering the secret ending, you will notice the station starting to twist and transform as Wonderland starts bleeding into reality.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-left" style="width:17.46%;"><img src="https://wiki.fulp.gg/jabberocky.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Several hostile player-controlled creatures with dangerous abilities will start invading the station that the crew &nbsp;must fight off. This is a round-ending catastrophe which is why you typically wouldn't want a monster hunter &nbsp;roaming your station.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
