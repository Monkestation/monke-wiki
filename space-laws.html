<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Space Law is a collection of rules and regulations enacted by Nanotrasen which has oversight through CentCom and is enforced by the Sec Officers on the station. Space Law applies to all ranks and positions on station, from the lowliest Assistant to the highest Captain, all are equal under the eyes of the Law and ultimately answer to it. As such, a good working knowledge of Space Law is important for any person on the station, though a &nbsp;more in-depth understanding of space law is required for such positions as the Lawyer, Warden, and the Head of Security.</p>
<h1>The Law: Crime Codes</h1>
<p>Refer to Glossary of Crimes at the end for a description of each crime.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.fulp.gg/spacelawchart.png"></figure>
<h1>General info</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Confiscated items must be placed in evidence, not left on the brig floor or your personal use, until they can be returned to their rightful owners.</li>
  <li>Security is prohibited from using most Syndicate contraband.</li>
  <li>Intent is important in determining the level of some crimes. If intent can’t be determined, the lesser charge should be given.</li>
  <li>Criminals who commit multiple crimes may have charges stacked. The sentences for multiple crimes should run consecutively, not concurrently.<ul>
      <li>Charges in the same row should not be stacked for the same count; instead, charge the crew member with the highest applicable offense <i>per count</i>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If a crew member is de-converted from revolutionary or cult groups, all charges related to their time in the organization should be dropped, and they should be given a mindshield (if possible).</li>
  <li>The warden is responsible for ensuring that all prisoners are safe and that the brig is secure. Failure to do this can result in demotion.</li>
  <li>A crew member cannot be held for more than 10 minutes without being processed. If 10 minutes elapses and no evidence is provided, the crew member should be set free.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Arresting a Head of Staff</strong></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Warrants for heads of staff must be approved by the Head of Security, Captain, or Centcom.</li>
  <li>Warrants for the Captain must be approved by Centcom.</li>
  <li>Demotion of a command member and promotion of acting command must be approved by the captain.</li>
</ol>
<p>It can safely be assumed that a head of staff is threatening to arrest. Bring backup.</p>
<h1>Punishments</h1>
<h2><strong>Brigging</strong></h2>
<p>The Warden, Head of Security, and Captain all share authority over the brig. Brigging procedures are primarily the job of the warden, but can be done by the HoS or arresting officer should the warden be unavailable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Standard Operational Procedures for brigging are as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Take the prisoner to a brig cell, set the time and activate the timer. Inform the warden if additional time will need to be added.</li>
  <li>Enter the cell with the prisoner in tow, open the cell locker, and hold the prisoner over it.</li>
  <li>Empty their pockets and remove their gloves, backpacks, tool belt, gas masks, and any flash resistant equipment such as Sunglasses, Welding Masks/Goggles, Space Helmets, etc.<ul>
      <li>Ask Plasmamen where their plasma tank is. Do not empty that slot or remove their uniform, helmet, or gloves. They need those to live.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Buckle the prisoner to the bed.</li>
  <li>Search the items removed (including internals box in their backpack) and confiscate any contraband, stolen items, or tools that could be used to commit future crimes.</li>
  <li>Close the locker and lock it.</li>
  <li>Stun the prisoner, remove their cuffs, stun them again, pick up the cuffs then leave the cell. Change the prisoner’s security record to DETAINED if this has not been done already.</li>
  <li>Modify their brig sentence for additional offences or good behavior, if applicable.</li>
  <li>Once they have served their sentence, set their status to DISCHARGED or PAROLED.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do NOT fully strip the prisoner unless they have earned a permanent sentence.</p>
<h2>Permabrigging</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Prisoners must be cuffed, and their ID must be terminated.</li>
  <li>Prisoners must be stripped of all belongings. Said belongings must be placed in one of the prisoner gear lockers, and the prisoner equipped with standard prisoner uniform and headset.<ul>
      <li>Plasmamen shouldn't be stripped of their uniform, helmet and gloves if there is no prisoner equivalent available and should keep their plasma internals.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Prisoners must be clothed in a prisoner uniform and shoes and given a Prisoner ID.</li>
  <li>Prisoners must be brought to the Permabrig area by the warden or HoS and the doors closed properly behind them.</li>
  <li>Prisoners must be buckled cuffed to one of the beds.</li>
  <li>Prisoner must have his cuffs removed and the cuffs recovered before the officers leave.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Execution</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Prisoners must be cuffed, and their ID must be terminated.</li>
  <li>Prisoners must be stripped of all belongings and placed in one of the prisoner gear lockers, and the prisoner equipped with standard prisoner uniform.<ul>
      <li>Plasmamen shouldn't be stripped of their uniform, helmet and gloves as there is no prisoner equivalent available and should keep their plasma internals.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Prisoners must be brought to the Prisoner Transfer room.</li>
  <li>It is advised, but not required, to have a Brig Physician in attendance to verify death. A chaplain may be present to give last rites.</li>
  <li>Authorization must be given by the Captain. If a Captain is not assigned, dead, missing, or otherwise rendered incapable of providing authorization, the Acting Captain may authorize an execution in their stead. Should the Captain and Acting Captain be unable to provide authorization, it must come from Central Command. Without authorization, executions are murder.</li>
  <li>Though not obligatory, it is recommended that all executed prisoners be considered for borgification post-execution.</li>
  <li>Update the security and medical records of the executed prisoner.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Gulag/ Labor Camp</strong></h2>
<ol>
  <li>After searching the prisoner and confiscating contraband, weapons, and stolen items, have the warden or HoS put the prisoner in the prisoner teleporter. DO NOT STRIP THE PRISONER OR PUT THEM IN A JUMPSUIT.</li>
  <li>Assign a prisoner a prison ID by putting it in the prisoner management console and assign a point value (1 minute = 100 points).<ul>
      <li>For perma prisoners, skip this step.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Press the “Process Prisoner” button. The prisoner will be automatically dressed in a prisoner outfit and their items will be held in the teleporter until they complete their point total.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Security Policies and Practices</h1>
<h2>Legal Representation and Trials</h2>
<p>Prisoners are permitted to seek legal representation; however, you are under no obligation to provide or allow this. Lawyers, and by extension the Head of Personnel, exist to serve as a guiding hand and the voice of reason within the judicial process, but they have zero authority over the brig, security personnel, prisoners, or sentencing. The lawyer's security headset is a privilege not a right. Security personnel are under no requirement to listen to them, and security channel abuse is to result in that privilege being revoked. If the lawyer continuously acts as a disruptive influence, Security personnel are fully permitted to confiscate their access, remove them from the brig and bar their future access to it.</p>
<p>In instances where a conflict of opinion arises over the sentence of a prisoner the chain of command must be followed. This goes, from top to bottom: Captain &gt; Head of Security &gt; Warden &gt; Sec Officer.</p>
<p>Trials are not to be performed for timed sentences. This is mainly for the benefit of the accused as trials will often run many times the length of the actual sentence.</p>
<p>Trials may be performed for capital crimes and permanent detention; however, there is no requirement to hold them. Forensic evidence, witness testimony, or confessions are all that is required for the Head of Security, Warden, or Captain to authorize their sentence.</p>
<p>In cases where the death penalty is desired but the Captain (or Acting Captain) is unable or unwilling to authorize the execution, a trial is required to authorize the death penalty.</p>
<h2>Use of Deadly Force</h2>
<p>As a member of the station's Security force you are one of the best armed and protected people on the station, equipped with the almost latest in non-lethal takedown technology.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that the situations that warrant the use of Deadly Force are few and far between. In most circumstances you will be expected to use your stun weapons to diffuse a situation.</p>
<p>There are a few circumstances where deadly force is permissible:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Code Red Situation - situations which would warrant a code red, such as: full blown mutinies, hostile boarding parties, and space wizards automatically authorize lethal force. Note: The alert status is not required to be elevated to code red as in most of these scenarios the chain of command will be too damaged or otherwise occupied to raise the alert level.</li>
  <li>Non-Lethal Weapons Ineffective - certain targets are impervious to NLWs, such as mechs, xenomorphs, borgs, and hulks. Lethal force may be used against these targets if they prove hostile until they are incapacitated. Victims should either be revived or the execution should be posthumously approved by the captain.</li>
  <li>Severe Personal Risk - sometimes getting close enough to a target to slap the cuffs on will create significant personal risk to the officer. Deadly force from range is recommended to subdue hostile wizards and changelings.</li>
  <li>Criminals in hostile environments such as space, fire, or plasma leaks also fall into this category, as do criminals believed to be in possession of high explosives. Ranged lethal force is the only reasonable option in these conditions.</li>
  <li>Armed and Dangerous - if a suspect is in possession of weapons, including stun weapons, and you have reasonable suspicion that they will use these against you, lethal force is permitted. However, it is still preferable to attempt to detain them non-lethally.<ul>
      <li>Unauthorized personnel in the armory are considered to be armed and dangerous by default. Maximum force is permitted to subdue such targets.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Multiple Hostiles - it can be extremely difficult to detain multiple hostiles. As a last resort, you may deploy your baton in a harmful manner to thin the crowd.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, if it is possible to capture personnel non-lethally you should. If you do not, expect to have to justify yourself to Internal Affairs to not get fired and to administrators to not be job banned.</p>
<h2>Enemy of the corporation and Accessory</h2>
<p>Accessory: Accessory charges can be given to anyone who assists a criminal in committing a crime or escaping from security. The sentence for accessory charges can be the same as the original criminal up to and including execution, though the HoS and warden are allowed to give a lesser charge. Intent or knowledge of the original crime is not needed. This can also be applied to crew members who are masters of golems or pAIs if those creations commit a significant enough crime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enemy of the corporation: Current enemies of Nanotrasen currently include: The Syndicate, Bloodsuckers, The Changeling Hivemind, Heretics, and The Cult of Nar'Sie. Deconversion should always be the top priority whenever possible. Execution of revolutionaries and cultists is only authorized when deconversion is not possible or poses too significant of a risk. For enemies of the corporation who pose too great a threat to detain, immediate execution is authorized.</p>
