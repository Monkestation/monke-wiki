<h1>Bloodsuckers</h1>
<p>So, you're a Bloodsucking vampire aboard Space Station 13. Hope <s>admins</s> god has mercy on you.</p>
<h2>Returning from the Dead</h2>
<p>Bloodsuckers are undead predators out to enslave the station to their will. Though they can recognize eachother, they usually act independent of one another.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.fulp.gg/bloodsucker/bloodsucker.png" alt="bloodsucker.png"></figure>
<h2>Traits</h2>
<p>Passively resistant to brute, with passive supernatural healing scaling with level.</p>
<p>Night and Thermal vision for Bloodsucking needs in the dark.</p>
<p>Undead, therefore has cold blood, a non-beating heart, complete immunity to toxin and oxygen damage, and can't fall asleep or enter critical condition (outside of Torpor).</p>
<p>Weak to burn damage, including fire, hot temperatures and lasers.</p>
<p>Constant blood loss.</p>
<p>Lack of DNA, making it easy to find out with a Genetic Analyzer.</p>
<p>Weak to bright light, requiring 2 layers of protection for flashing/welders.</p>
<h1>Life</h1>
<h2>Sol</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.fulp.gg/bloodsucker/solnight.png" alt="solnight.png"></figure>
<p><br>Bloodsuckers are active during the night and may roam freely, while their hud tells them how much time there is until the inevitable daytime. By default, Sol starts every 10 minutes, with a warning when there's 1.5 minutes left, and a second when there's 25 seconds left.<br>Vassals also know when Sol is nearby, being given a minor warning when it's about to hit.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.fulp.gg/bloodsucker/solday.png" alt="solday.png"></figure>
<p><br>During the daytime, Bloodsuckers must be in a Coffin or Locker to avoid burning to death. Coffins will fully protect you from the UV lights, and your Claimed coffin can be locked so people don't open it mid-sol. Lockers offer some protection, but it is still dangerous, especially at higher levels.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The damage from Sol increases with your Rank. Rank 0 Bloodsuckers will not be set on fire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During Sol, Bloodsuckers will gain more ancient, giving them a Rank that they could spend to grow stronger. Entering a Coffin while they have unspent Ranks will allow them to spend them, but only if they are in a clan (which they do using the Antag info panel's second tab).</p>
<h2>The Masquerade</h2>
<p>The Masquerade is a code that all Bloodsuckers must follow to ensure their continued undead lives by preventing people from finding out of their existence.<br>Aggressively feeding off of someone too close to a non Bloodsucker/Vassal/Curator will land you a Masquerade infraction, getting 3 will officially break the Masquerade.<br>Additionally, if the Curator discovers you with their Archives of the Kindred, that will instantly break the Masquerade.</p>
<p>Once the Masquerade is broken, your hud will turn blue, become <strong>valid to all other Bloodsuckers</strong>, and Malkavian Bloodsuckers will gain the objective to ensure your death. Additionally, Curators will be able to tell you are a Bloodsucker from simply examining you, just like a Vassal would.<br>Your Vassals will additionally no longer be fully commited to you, allowing other Bloodsuckers to steal and Vassalize them for themselves.</p>
<h2>Humanity</h2>
<p>Humanity decides how fast you enter a <strong>Frenzy</strong>, and <strong>how much burn damage you get while inside one</strong>. Feeding off of a rat (Unless Nosferatu or Malkavian) will cause you to lose some humanity, while feeding on someone until they die will cause you to lose a lot.<br>Bloodsuckers will be notified if they happen to have lost some of their Humanity.</p>
<h2>Frenzy</h2>
<p>Once Bloodsuckers lose enough blood (determined by Humanity), they will enter a <strong>Frenzy</strong>.</p>
<p>While in a Frenzy, your screen turns a blood-red as you gain the ability to instantly aggressively grab people. Your <strong>Feed</strong> ability will get a major buff while in Frenzy, drinking at a massively increased speed and drink rate.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you are part of the <strong>Ventrue Clan</strong>, you can bypass the need to drink from only conscious people.</li>
  <li>You lose access to all Abilities except <strong>Feed</strong>, as well as become Mute, Deaf, and immune to ALL stuns. You will lose the ability to use nearly all machinery. While in a Frenzy, you will begin to take Burn damage, and your task is to drink 300 Blood as soon as possible to exit a Frenzy.</li>
  <li>If you are in Sol, you will <strong>not wake up</strong>. Unless some external source helps you, this typically is your largest threat.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Powers</h1>
<p>As a bloodsucker, you have an array of different and unique powers. After every day passes, you ‘level up’, and have to claim it by sleeping in a coffin and choosing a <strong>power</strong>. This only works if you are part of a Clan.<br>Leveling up will upgrade all current powers, increase your strength, resistance, health, feed rate, regen rate, and maximum blood, but increase the damage you take from burn and solar flares.</p>
<p><strong>There are 2 types of powers</strong>: <i>Single use</i>, and <i>constant cost</i></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Single Use</strong>: Can be used once before going on cooldown, instantly taking full blood cost.</li>
  <li><strong>Constant Cost</strong>: Passive power that drains blood overtime, cooldown begins once the power has been deactivated.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>You can find more (and generally more up-to-date) information on Powers using your Antag Panel in-game.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Starting powers</h2>
<h3>Feed</h3>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.fulp.gg/bloodsucker/feed.png" alt="feed.png"></figure>
<p><br>Constant cost power that sucks the blood of a nearby human or rat. Blood is sucked faster if the target is passively grabbed. Additionally, the target will be put to sleep if aggressively grabbed. Feeding on a rat as non Nosferatu/Malkavian, or feeding on a human until they die, will cause you to lose Humanity. Aggressively feeding on a human while near another non Bloodsucker/Vassal will cause a Masquerade violation.</p>
<p>Feed will not work unless you are at least Level 1.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You gain one rank for free when entering a Clan through your Antag Panel UI, enter a Coffin to claim it once complete.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Veil of many Faces</h3>

<p><br>Constant cost power which hides your identity, becoming a new person until the ability is deactivated.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Security HUDs will still display you as your old job, including your security records. Keep this in mind when attempting to fool Security, or are set to arrest.</li>

<p><br>Single user power, a simple two tiles movement, which can let the user skip past doors, barricades, and windows, while also removing restraints.</p>
<h2>Tremere Powers</h2>

<p><br>Constant cost power, slowly regenerates Brute, Burn and Toxin damage, in exchange for Blood and Stamina. Done by the mixing of your master's blood with your own. Does not cost your Master's blood.</p>
<h3>Distress (Ventrue Favorite Vassal power)</h3>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.fulp.gg/newdistress.png" alt="newdistress.png"></figure>

<p><br>Single user power, bring a Vassal back into the Fold. RMB: Check Vassal status.<br>Using the Power while you have an Ex-Vassal (A Vassal with a dead Master) in your grab will instead slave them to you, however they will be on a timer that will deconvert them unless feed them with Blood, which you gain by using the ability while you have a blood bag in your hand. Right-clicking on the Power will give a status of all enslaved Vassals.</p>
<h1>Vassals</h1>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.fulp.gg/bloodsucker/vassal.png" alt="vassal.png"></figure>
<p><br>As a vampire, you can create <strong>Vassals</strong>. Vassals are normal crewmembers who serve you due to <s>torture</s> <strong>persuasion</strong> and are <i>addicted to your blood</i>.<br>Vassals obtain complete loyalty to you, and are deconverted either by your death, or by Mindshielding. They get the <strong>Recuperate</strong> power and a pinpointer that always points to their Master's direction.<br>Vassals are useful, as they are Human to an Asimov AI, and are an extra helping hand whenever you're in trouble.</p>
<p>If a Vassal's Master dies, they become an Ex-Vassal, open to falling victim to a Revenge Vassal or another Bloodsucker.</p>
<h2>Special Vassals</h2>
<p>Bloodsuckers can assign special Vassals through the persuasion rack by attempting to vassalize an already-existing Vassal. These vassals gain special abilities depending on the Clan and Type. You can only have one of each type per round.</p>
<h3>The Favorite</h3>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gains a unique HUD icon</li>
  <li>Resists Mindshielding</li>
  <li>Gains a random benefit depending on your Clan:</li>
</ul>
<p>Caitiff - Gains the Brawn ability<br>Nosferatu - Gains the ability to Ventcrawl while naked and becomes disfigured<br>Tremere - Gains the ability to turn into a bat and back at will<br>Ventrue - Gains Distress and allows the Bloodsucker to slowly turn them into a Bloodsucker<br>Malkavian - Hallucinates and gains phobetor prophet (Beefmen tears)</p>
<h3>The Revenge</h3>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gains a unique HUD icon</li>
  <li>Upon their master's death, they will gain all their Bloodsucker powers, and gain a new ability to start a Clan with the other Vassals. This means they are not deconverted (except by Mindshield).</li>
</ul>
<p>Gets the Fold ability when their Master dies, carrying on their legacy by keeping their Vassals' addictions running off of artificial Bloodsucker blood. They can examine people to tell if they are an ex-vassal.</p>
<h1>Playable Clans</h1>
<p>Through their Antagonist UI page, Bloodsuckers can (and should) join a Clan.<br>There are more Clans in the game, but are unplayable through regular means, and is usually meant for just flavortext (though there are some very limited mechanics to them).</p>
<h2>Caitiff</h2>
<p>Caitiff means 'No Clan', it is the default way of playing Bloodsuckers.</p>
<h2>Nosferatu Clan</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Clan Objective: Ensure Nosferatu steals and keeps control over the Archive of the Kindred.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You <i>lose</i> the Masquerade and Veil abilities, become <i>permanently</i> disfigured, permanently become Pale Death, and get a bad back, in exchange for the ability to Ventcrawl at will. Maintenance is your best friend here, as anyone can tell you're a Bloodsucker from a simple Examine!</p>
<h2>Tremere Clan</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Clan Objective: Upgrade a Blood Magic power to the maximum level, remember that Vassalizing gives more Ranks!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tremere Bloodsuckers will ignite if they enter the Chapel.<br>They also lose all non default Powers, and instead gain 3 new Tremere Powers that they Rank up overtime;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Auspex</li>
  <li>Dominate</li>
  <li>Thaumaturgy</li>
</ul>
<p>They also gain a new Rank to spend at their Coffin when Vassalizing someone, allowing them to grow faster as they are not required to wait for Sol.</p>
<h2>Ventrue Clan</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Clan Objective: Use the Candelabrum to Rank your Favorite Vassal up enough to become a Bloodsucker.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are limtied to purchasing 3 powers, afterwards you must spend it on your Favorite Vassal by buckling them onto a <i>Candelabrum</i> and clicking on it, like a Persuasion Rack. If you do not have any spare Ranks, you can instead spend 550 Blood. Your current powers will be Ranked up with your Favorite Vassal. You also lose the ability to drink blood out of non-sentient beings (Unless in a Frenzy).</p>
<p>Abilities you can purchase for your Favorite Vassal:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Brawn</li>
  <li>Fortitude</li>
  <li>Immortal Haste</li>
  <li>Predatory Lunge</li>
  <li>Mesmerize</li>
  <li>Trespass</li>
  <li>Veil of Many Faces</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, your Favorite Vassal will become more Vampiric as they level up.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>At Rank 1, they become immune to deconversion by Mindshielding.<br>At Rank 2, they become Coldblooded, no longer Breathe and get Ageusia.<br>At Rank 3, they become immune to Softcrit.<br>At Rank 4, they become Sleep and Disease immune (This doesn't cure any diseases they already had)<br>At Rank 5, they become immune to Hardcrit and become resistant to wounds.<br>At Rank 6, they become a full-Bloodsucker, though they cannot rank themselves up.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Malkavian Clan</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Clan Objective: Final Death any Bloodsucker who breaks the Masquerade.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You gain x-ray, and begin to constantly hallucinate, as well as become a Bluespace Prophet, gaining the ability to enter Bluespace tears in reality, even when people are looking. They will also, unless on Masquerade, spit out random 'Revelations'.</p>
<h1>Your base</h1>
<p>A Bloodsucker's Base means everything, as it is where they sleep during Sol, and Vassalize crewmembers.</p>
<h2>Coffin</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.fulp.gg/bloodsucker/coffin.png" alt="coffin.png"></figure>
<p><br>An important step is to create your lair. Your lair will be defined by your coffin, but <i>you can also sleep on other coffins and have the same effect, albeit they won’t be bolted and can easily be opened by anyone</i>.<br>To create a coffin, you need to either use Wood in hand, or access the structures section of your crafting menu. You unlock stronger coffins in the crafting menu once you have a lair claimed.<br>Entering a coffin will allow you to claim it, causing that area to become your ‘lair’. Structures such as the <strong>persuasion rack</strong> can only be built while you have a lair, and can only be built within it.<br>AltClicking your coffin will unclaim your lair, unbolting your Coffin and all other Bloodsucker structures.</p>
<h2>Persuasion Rack</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.fulp.gg/bloodsucker/persuasionrack.png" alt="persuasionrack.png"></figure>
<p><br>The persuasion rack is built with 2 cable cuffs, metal, wood, a welder and a wrench from the structures section of your crafting menu. <strong>It is only available once you have a coffin claimed, and can only be built in your base.</strong><br>Clicking it with an empty hand <i>in your lair</i> will secure it in place, allowing you to buckle people to it, and they can be unsecured using a <strong>Wrench</strong>.</p>
<p>When someone is buckled to the rack, clicking it will begin to torture whoever is on it.<br><strong>The process can be made faster depending on the item in your alternate hand;</strong><br><i>Slowest - Empty | Fast - Blunt object | Faster - Sharp object | Fastest - Open Welder</i><br>The tortute process takes 3-4 attempts, and if it succeeds, they are turned into your loyal <strong>Vassal</strong>.<br>If the person is already your Vassal, you will be offered to turn them into a Special Vassal type.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If the target is <strong>Mindshielded</strong>, the victim has to willingly join you, and will lose their mindshield upon accepting.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Candelabrum</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.fulp.gg/bloodsucker/candelabrum.png" alt="candelabrum.png"></figure>
<p><br>The Candelabrum is built with 3 Iron, 1 Iron Rod, 1 Red Candle, a Welder and a Wrench.<br>Wrenching the Candelabrum down will secure it in place, allowing you to turn it on and off. Bloodsuckers can AltClick from a distance to toggle it, and both Bloodsuckers and Vassals can click on it to toggle.<br>Non Bloodsuckers/Vassals near the Candelabrum as it is active will cause them to get a major mood debuff, and will cause them to begin to hallucinate.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>Bloodsuckers part of the Ventrue clan requires this to raise their Favorite Vassal</i>, dragging their Favorite Vassal onto the Candelabrum as it is wrenched down will buckle them into it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Blood Throne</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.fulp.gg/bloodsucker/throne.png" alt="throne.png"></figure>
<p>The Blood throne is built with 3 Cloth, 5 Iron, 1 Wood and a Wrench.<br><strong>Wrenching it in place in your Lair will allow you to buckle yourself onto it.</strong><br>While buckled into a Blood Throne, anything Bloodsuckers say, will instead be broadcasted to all their Vassals. Any Non-Bloodsucker buckling themselves in will horribly fail.</p>
<h1>Enemies</h1>
<h2>Archives of the Kindred</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.fulp.gg/bloodsucker/archives.png" alt="archives.png"></figure>
<blockquote>
  <p>Cryptic documents explaining hidden truths behind Undead beings. It is said only Curators can decipher what they really mean.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Archives of the Kindred can only be used by Curators.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reading one will allow them to read up on the several Clans there are, including their strengths and weaknesses.</li>
  <li>Using it on someone will, after a 3 second delay, tell you if the attacked is a Bloodsucker, telling you their full REAL name, and Clan (if in one).</li>
</ul>
<p>The Archives will not work on any Bloodsucker currently using the <strong>Masquerade</strong> ability.</p>
<h3>Curators</h3>
<p>Curators are the only ones with knowledge on what a Bloodsucker is. They are equipped with the <strong>Archives of the Kindred</strong>, and is the only person on station able to use it. They are Historians, and can tell Bloodsuckers apart from simply examining them, if they have broken the Masquerade.</p>
<h2>Stakes</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://wiki.fulp.gg/bloodsucker/hunter.png" alt="hunter.png"></figure>
<p><br>Stakes are a Bloodsucker's worst enemy. If embedded, a Bloodsucker will not heal in a Coffin, nor will they be able to use their powers. Additionally, forcing a stake through a Torpor'ed Bloodsuckers chest will cause Final Death, gibbing them.<br>Stakes are all listed under the WEAPONRY tab in the crafting menu, though the wooden stake itself can also be crafted by using a sharp object on a piece of wood.</p>
<h1>Bloodsucker tips</h1>
<p>Getting armor is important. You're still very weak to burn damage, so lasers will be very lethal against you. The reflective trenchcoat will help against this.</p>
<p>Predatory Lunge + Feed is a good strategy to take down unsuspecting targets.</p>
<p>Your fists are your weapon. As you Rank up, your punch damage increases, making you a very dangerous foe on melee combat.</p>
<p>If you feel hunted, you can spend the day in a locker. Lower levels are less dangerous to spend on, And there’s a huge difference between being defenseless for 1 minute sleeping inside a coffin and 20 seconds healing back your burn damage in a coffin.</p>
<p>Since vassaling requires harming someone, a good tool will make vassaling faster. A good example is a <i>welding tool</i>, which makes the process faster than simply using your fists.</p>
<p>A good place to find metal is auxiliary base, and maintenance usually has wood in either 50 stack planks or wooden barricades, along with several public areas (these commonly being library or the bar) having wooden tables.</p>
