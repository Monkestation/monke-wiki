# Mytho's
The monkestations have had a lot of myths and legends throughout the years, some of these myths are about fairies that shock you in the maints, some about a mythical gumby, and some about a station run entirely by monkey's.
## General Myth's
-Guardian Angel: A being that is usually chocked up to a crew member being lucky in surviving some of the worst the station has to offer, thought to have helped out kilgor and other crew members on multiple occasions. 
-Maint Fairies/Gremlins: Fairies having been around since a good portion of human history, some of the more superstitous crew members have said that fairies exist in maints and that they are the ones responsible for the electrocutions and other accidents that happen in the maint's.
-Space Traveling Alligators: Thought to be the predator to space carp, and a very dangerous one to crew, a few sightings since the stations where put in place or taken over by the centcom monke-sector branch, this being said to have been seen all over monke sector but all of the sightings have had bad camera and picture and recording quality, though fossils in some of the planets in monke sector have shown fossilized crocodile eggs in meteor impact sights, and some crocodile skeletons have been found in the planets most recent crust and top layers, suggesting there might be more to this myth then it seems.
