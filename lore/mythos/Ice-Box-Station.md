# Myth's of Ice Box Station
the Myth's of Ice Box Station is ones of rather cold origins, as this base was dead when centcom found it, and the place had been trashed, there was no corpses, but there was blood all over the station, and multiple broken down doors.
## The Yeti
The Yeti is said to have been the one responsible for the blood bath in the base and is claimed to have killed everything including robots and the ai.

This creature is described as a 9-15 Foot tall(2.7432-4.572 Meters), clad in all white fur and huge feet bigger then any known human feet, or ape feet. It is basically a blood thirsty monster that loves to rip and tear apart creatures, and living in a ice cave somewhere on the map, so it is discouraged from going out there in the snow as the yeti will kill anyone who enters its territory, it also doesn't take any damage from cold and can breath with no pressure out there, it can also tear open doors.
