# Tramstation Myths
The tramstation myth's are rather unique, from spiders the size of the tram car, to an ancient corpse of a huge squid faced being in the asteroid itself.
## Tram Demon
A myth that has been going around since the tram station was taking over by centcom monkesector teams. It is said that the tram isn't an oridinary tram, that a demon inhabits it, a blood thirsty demon, that the previous people who owned the station put into the tram, as a last ditch effort to keep control of the station, this demon has been said to be responsible for tens of thousands of deaths from the tram ramming into people at high speeds, and crushing them and shredding and destroying their bodies, as the higher the amount of crew on the station the more amount of people that die from the tram, could be a consisdence but the more logical people think its just due to people being dumb and taking teh walkways that connect the 2 sides of the station while a tram is coming.
## Old God Corpse
a corpse is said to be at the center of the asteroid that tramstation sits on, it being a giant body with a squid like head and giant bat like wings on its back, and thousands of tenetacle and regular hands and arms. It is said to turn anyone who see's it into a blood drunk miner.
