There are a few mysteries that we will be discussing here.

## The Worm.
The worm being seen on this station more freqently then others, it being what seems to be a worm that will constantly piss and is blind, it is a being with a tail no limbs and no eyes. all these being does is scream and can piss an infinite amount of piss, and make an entire station be **FLOODED** with **PISS** it is something the worm can do, it is unknown where the worm gets this much piss, but thought to be from an ancient piss god.

## Sea dragons-(Confirmed)-
Sea dragons where thought to be extinct, but it was recently found that the sea dragons just migrated into the trenches after the building of the station was finished, The seadragons being a huge challenge for the scuba-miners of the station, they are advised to only attack/get close to them if it is absolutely necessary or you **KNOW** You can handle them, the sea dragons where a uncommon occurence when Oshan station was being made, so it was thought that they had all been killed by a scuba death squad sent in to kill them and to stop them from destroying the station that had been under construction and suffering delays as the Sea Dragons had been eating workers and melting and puncturing entire parts of the structure like foundations and walls with their high pressured water stream breath and their fire breath and their acid breath.
